Company Overview: Myanmar National Airlines is the national flag carrier of Myanmar and has the most extensive route network within our country. Our airline has been in existence for over 65 years and we are one of the oldest and most experienced airlines in Asia.

Major change is underway as we launched our new domestic service in 2014 with fixed schedules, state of the art Reservations and Airport Systems, a brand new Premium Economy on our Embraer 190 aircraft and upgraded food and inflight service throughout our fleet.

In 2015 we start to fly International again after a break of many years providing regional jet services to neighbouring countries. This will allow Myanmar people to stretch their wings alongside us and for us to welcome many more visitors to our country.

Later in 2015 we welcome our brand new Boeing 737 aircraft into our fleet. This will allow us to expand out international network and offer an even better experience for our customers.

Company Overview: We are the only agency operating in all five countries of Indochina and the six key cities of Bangkok, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh, Phnom Penh, Vientiane, and Yangon. But even more importantly for us, the five countries of Indochina are the only place we operate. For the 220 of us who make up riverorchid, Indochina is our sole focus.  We believe it has to be that way as Indochina is kaleidoscopically complex with a myriad of colliding yet co-existing cultures, languages, scripts, ethnicities, religions, climates, and values (read more in Our Indochina).

riverorchid also remains independently owned. Supported as we are by our large team of Indochina’s most experienced professionals combined with multi-award winning global talent, this means that we can offer genuinely world class work, but do so without being encumbered with the very heavy central costs and time-consuming bureaucracy which go with being owned by a major network agency.

Company Overview: We thank all passengers who have always supported Air Bagan throughout the eight years of our airline’s operation.
Additionally, I’d like to thank all employees of Air Bagan, Management and staff at Htoo Group of Companies, Travel Agencies, Local Authorities and Residents who wholeheartedly assisted and extended their support to Air Bagan with goodwill on handling the Crisis Management during the unfortunate mishap which took place on Christmas Day of 2012 at Heho.
 Air Bagan started adopting the Safety Management System (SMS) recommended by ICAO as early as 2006. This recommended SMS was declared MANDATORY for all Myanmar AOC holders by Myanmar Department of Civil Aviation on 01/07/2010.
Adopting and practising SMS will not stop mistakes. However, it will recognize that human error is inevitable and attempts to put defenses in place for these inevitable errors before they occur. Where the SMS does not prevent an incident or accident, the SMS will capture the lessons learnt from that event and improve itself. Air Bagan will further enhance the safety standards through training standard and better training programmes.
 In conjunction with adopting safety enhancement capability, Air Bagan, since  March 2012 had started using e-ticketing system and it is the first domestic airline in Myanmar to use Computerised Reservation System. Furthermore, we are currently in the process of opening up Distribution Channels enabling Online Bookings via internet with Global Distribution System and Amadeus System for Air Bagan’s domestic route network. We expect to introduce this service shortly.
Besides offering unrivalled air transport services to our passengers, Air Bagan also provide social services in the form of charities and donations during natural disasters, to orphanages, and other social and health care requirements in conjunction with Htoo Foundation.
 I would again like to express my sincere thanks on behalf of Air Bagan to all our passengers and travel agents who always have maintained their support over our 8 years of operation and still continuing.

Company Overview: Dear Shareholders, 

I am happy to report that we are steadily progressing with our conglomerate approach to building a diversified portfolio of businesses in Myanmar. As the country continues its rapid pace of development, Yoma Strategic is well placed to participate in this growth momentum, both in terms of our core businesses as well as in new business endeavours. We had another year of solid performance for the financial year ended 31 March 2014 (“FY2014”). 

Myanmar’s progress provided us with exciting opportunities and its fair share of challenges. Our nascent democracy, though laudable, had its dose of labour pains. The country’s weak infrastructure continues to be an impediment to faster growth and efficiency. In the sectors of power generation, financial services, transportation and telecommunications, these deficiencies are particularly evident and are in need of immediate attention. It is however equally evident that the incumbent Government has been working as fast as it can to overcome these obstacles to development. 

As ‘hard’ infrastracture is being upgraded, ‘soft’ infrastructure such as the promulgation of legislation, adherence to the rule of law, implementation of responsible business practices and augmentation of our human capital will prove to be key elements to Myanmar’s development. As we embark down the road of reform, progress and development, the success of the Government’s plans for inclusiveness, social equality and alleviation of poverty will become important factors on how the country chooses to define itself. 

Acceptance from the Global Community

FY2014 has been a momentous year for Myanmar. The Government has continued its pace of economic and political reforms, having promulgated the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Law and the Foreign Investment Law (FIL), both of which were received favourably by the global business community. The year witnessed Myanmar taking the chair for the Association of South East Asian Nations (“ASEAN”). Seen in context, this chairmanship becomes even more signficant as Myanmar will play a crucial role in guiding ASEAN’s ten-member economies towards a planned economic integration in 2015. Myanmar also successfully hosted the SEA Games in December 2013, after a 44-year interval since it last hosted the SEA Games in 1969. 

These key regional events have given confidence to many that the transformation of Myanmar into a full-fledged member of the global community is credible. The numerous visits made by both President Thein Sein and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to their western counterparts, and vice versa, also symbolise this growing acceptance of Myanmar into the global community. 

Towards Continued Growth

The challenges for the country remain, particularly in the upgrading of infrastructure. Currently, the majority of our people still live in rural areas but this is likely to shift rapidly as the country continues its growth path. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, the share of Myanmar’s population in large cities could double by 2030, which could mean an additional ten million people migrating from rural to urban areas. The pressure on upgrading and improving the infrastructure in cities will become inevitable. 

Infrastructure

There are still many opportunities and challenges for infrastructure, even though there have been improvements over the past few years. Better infrastructure in the areas of transportation, telecommunications, financial services and housing to name a few, will naturally create a conducive business environment for investments, which the country sorely needs. This will directly and indirectly benefit Yoma Strategic’s core businesses. For instance, the establishment of the Thilawa SEZ, has created additional demand for our Star City development which is located in the vicinity. 

One of the major infrastructural developments that occurred in FY2014 was the award of two mobile licences to international telecommunications firms to develop Myanmar’s mobile communication infrastructure. Although the consortium in which Yoma Strategic participated was not awarded the tender, we have continued to stay “in the game” with an investment in a telecommunications towers company together with our partner, Digicel Group Limited. 

People

Capacity building and developing the country’s human resources will become one of the most important factors in the coming years. As the country continues to develop the need to attract talented people to work in Myanmar will grow. To encourage people to move to Myanmar, much improvement will be needed in the areas of education and healthcare. 

Education will be critical if the country is to create a skilled workforce. Seeing this potential in the education space, we have teamed up with international education service providers – Harrow International Management Services and Education Index Management (overseen by Dulwich College International) to provide international standard education services at our flagship PHGE and Star City developments. In addition, there will also be a local school within Star City that will be utilizing modern teaching methods to present a Myanmar curriculum. We believe that these projects will bring significant benefits to the local community and will consequentially increase the value of our real estate developments. The demand for wider coverage of better quality healthcare services will increase along with the growth of the economy. Historically, the Government had allocated a relatively small percentage of its GDP to healthcare. Today, there is less than one doctor for every 1000 of Myanmar’s population. It is an area offering both a key challenge as well as an attractive opportunity worth studying. 

On our part, we have taken a small step towards contributing to proper health and nutrition with our venture into the Dairy Business. Along with our affiliates in Myanmar, FMI and PMM, we aim to supply UHT dairy products to the local consumer market in Myanmar. This will be a significant project for our Group and I look forward to providing you more details as we progress in the near future. 

Boosting capacity for Yoma Strategic

Yoma Strategic has announced several key developments in FY2014. The pace of Yoma Strategic’s growth can be seen as a direct reflection of the pace of growth in Myanmar. As Myanmar develops, one can almost see Yoma Strategic as a microcosm of the country’s development. 

During the year, a record number of partnerships have been inked, which is a reflection of the amount of interest foreign companies are showing in Myanmar. Our businesses have expanded both in depth and in scale due to the large number of viable business opportunities within the country. 

We have appointed key executives and appointed experienced personnel to head our various business divisions in the Group. The profiles of these key management personnel can be found on pages 26 to 29 of this Annual Report. 

We are also grooming and training our middle management, including a number of locals, to take charge of the day-to-day operations in Myanmar. In addition, the trend of talent repatriation has been strong since the country opened up in 2010 with a growing number of Myanmar nationals, who had previously left the country to pursue studies or overseas work opportunities, now eager to return home with their international experience and education. We at Yoma Strategic recognised this phenomenon and have been recruiting these repatriates into our middle and top management. 

Shareholders’ Trip

During FY2014, the Group also hosted its inaugural Shareholders’ Trip to Yangon from 21 to 23 March 2014. Our management and staff were happy to host this group of 63 shareholders who wished to visit Yangon and observe our operations with their own eyes and get a sense of the business environment in Myanmar. I would like to thank the participating shareholders for their feedback and encouragement, as well as the efforts of the management to introduce and explain each of the Group’s projects to the visiting shareholders. 

In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to all the members of our Board as well as our management team for yet another year of strong performance. I would also like to thank all our shareholders and business associates who have supported us as we continue growing with Myanmar.
Serge Pun
Executive Chairman

Our commitment to help our clients deliver their global strategies has seen us build a truly global network now spanning 44 offices in 31 countries. We have also developed strong ties with relationship law firms in more than 100 countries where we do not have a presence.

This network has allowed us to become one of the largest and most connected law firms in our peer group with a global reach and local depth that is simply unrivalled.

So when we talk about global coverage, we’re not just talking about having offices in some important cities around the world. We mean being able to combine our international resources and sector expertise to work on cross-border transactions directly in the markets and regions important to our clients.

Company Overview: We are the first independent research agency in Myanmar – with over 25 years of experience in helping our clients to understand the Myanmar market, people and their different livelihoods.

about us

 

MSR was officially established as a private company in 1995, but already ‘embryo-ed’ earlier as there was demand for market information from foreign companies.

During all these years we have gained sound experience in two areas that together provide a holistic perspective of the situation in Myanmar – beyond the thriving metropolis of Yangon:

We track market developments, explore consumer needs and investigate industries to give you relevant insights for your market (entry) strategy

We conduct research for UN agencies and international NGOs on many different topics to provide necessary knowledge & learnings.

By the way, MSR staff were the first travelling into the Delta area after Cyclone Nargis hit the country in 2008 to do a Rapid Assessment. We consequently set-up the Myanmar Nargis Information Centre to provide all the information to NGOs so that they could act quickly.

Company Overview: The name Sedona is derived from the pure white Dendrobium Sedona orchid, which was bred for the first time in 1984 at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. 
Under the careful nurturing of its breeders, it finally bloomed in 1994 and was unveiled at the launch ceremony of Sedona Hotels.
The Dendrobium Sedona exemplifies the same warmth, graciousness and personable hospitality the Sedona brand strives to offer every visitor.

The font for the SEDONA logo was specifically created to reflect both the brand's timeless elegance and modern luxury offerings.
The classic serif in the first two letters of the logo ('S' and 'E') reminds one of Sedona's cultural wealth and immersion in tradition. The san-serif letters ('D', 'O', 'N' and 'A') that follow represent Sedona's contemporary comfort and ability to meet the modern traveller's needs.

Company Overview: Hintha Business Centres is named after the Hintha (or Hamsa) bird, a symbol of Bago city, a former capital of Myanmar.  Mythology has it that two Hintha birds flying during a flood could only find one dry rock poking above the flood waters on which to rest.  So the male bird landed on the rock, and allowed the female to land and rest on his back until the flood water subsided.   The imagery of the two ‘partner’ birds, one supporting the other, mirrors our values in seeking to support new business entering the Myanmar market.

Hintha Business Centres is part of Anthem Asia, an experienced private investment group dedicated to building and supporting sustainable local businesses in Myanmar.

This flag ship Executive Serviced Centre at 608 Merchant Street, is located in the very heart of downtown Yangon and incorporates the core values that lie at the heart of Anthem Asia – global reach, international standards, local inspiration and authentic, flexible partnership.

Company Overview: Welcome to our website and thank you for visiting. I hope that as you navigate through these pages, you will learn more about SPA Myanmar, our associates, affiliates, and partners.
After two decades as one of Myanmar’s leading business groups we find ourselves in remarkable times, as a great wave of economic, political and social change descends on our country.  As a diversified conglomerate, with operating companies in seven key sectors, we believe we are well placed for the future.
Twenty years in Myanmar
SPA Myanmar was founded in 1991, when a group of like-minded colleagues joined me to establish our first business venture. We shared a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve and had a bold plan of how to achieve it, and thus, Serge Pun & Associates (Myanmar) Ltd. was born. One year later we founded First Myanmar Investment Co., Ltd. (FMI), one of Myanmar’s earliest public companies, which has since become our flagship brand.
From these small beginnings, our Group has expanded over the years and, at the end of our second decade, we now operate a range of diverse businesses in seven key sectors – Financial Services, Real Estate, Services, Agriculture, Automobiles, Manufacturing & Trading and Retail.
Changing times
As the country moves forward towards a new era of political, social and economic development, the Group will strive to ride with the changing landscape and grow from strength to strength. We are at present focusing our resources on our core businesses while never losing sight of the many opportunities that a diversified business presents. We are expanding our partnerships with international firms of great repute to bring skills and experience to help Myanmar as it transforms and emerges onto the world stage.
SPA Myanmar is ready for any challenges that may come its way. We are confident that with our experience in various industries, as well as our strategic thinking, our professionalism, and our core of dedicated personnel, we are well-positioned for further successes well into the future.

Company Overview: Hintha Business Centres is named after the Hintha (or Hamsa) bird, a symbol of Bago city, a former capital of Myanmar.  Mythology has it that two Hintha birds flying during a flood could only find one dry rock poking above the flood waters on which to rest.  So the male bird landed on the rock, and allowed the female to land and rest on his back until the flood water subsided.   The imagery of the two ‘partner’ birds, one supporting the other, mirrors our values in seeking to support new business entering the Myanmar market.

Hintha Business Centres is part of Anthem Asia, an experienced private investment group dedicated to building and supporting sustainable local businesses in Myanmar.

This flag ship Executive Serviced Centre at 608 Merchant Street, is located in the very heart of downtown Yangon and incorporates the core values that lie at the heart of Anthem Asia – global reach, international standards, local inspiration and authentic, flexible partnership.

As the country opens up, a key issue for both foreign and local organizations is the lack of readily-available and reliable data. Since 1992, our teams have accumulated a wealth of knowledge and data on Myanmar through thousands of interviews, focus groups or surveys across all major industries and communities. MMRD has unrivaled capabilities when it comes to data collection, processing and analysis in order to provide our clients with unique insights on Myanmar business and social environment.

Company Overview: Our Integrity 
Producing our herbal medicinal products with a high degree of integrity is very important to us. The FAME pharmaceutical manufacturing plant was built under strict quality standards and is managed according to GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) guidelines set up by WHO and ISO. The plant was initially certified by complying with ISO 9001:2000 (Quality Management System) in 2002. In 2006, ISO 14001:2004 (Environmental Management System) and OHSAS 18001:2007 (Occupational Health and Safety Management System) were awarded by Bureau Veritas Certification, United Kingdom. Presently, the manufacturing plant is operating under the ISO 9001:2008 standard. In 2014 the plant achieved organic certification from the USDA to produce high quality organic finished products.

Our Organic Commitment
We are committed to sustainable organic agriculture and the healthy benefits it provides to the world’s population. The “FAME Organic Pharm” farming project was started in 2000 in Pyin Oo Lwin, Mandalay Division. FAME partnered with Sweden based Grolink Organic Farming Consultancy Service to initiate the first organic agriculture practice in Myanmar. In 2010, our organic farm was certified by Myanmar Organic Agriculture Group and Organic Agriculture Certification Thailand (ACT). To continue our organic commitment, the FAME farm was certified with the USDA Organic (United States Dept. of Agriculture, National Organic Program) and Australian Certified Organic in 2014.

Alternative Medicine
The FAME Clinic was established in 2010 using alternative medicine methods to treat patients in Myanmar with health problems associated with the urological, respiratory, central nervous, and cardiovascular systems. Alternative treatments included herbal medicine, homeopathy, diet and nutrition changes, and therapeutic exercises to patients with acute and chronic diseases.

Promoting A Healthy Lifestyle
We believe that “prevention” is the best medicine. Our FAME publishing house was established in 2005 to educate the public about healthy living, the dangers of synthetic chemicals in food chains, the causes of a variety of diseases. Since 2009, FAME has published the “Health Talk” and “Medicinal Plants” series to promote the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. The Health Talk series focuses on diet and nutrition while the Medicinal Plants series provides scientific knowledge about herbal medicinal plants. Today, the company has over 300 employees dedicated to producing a wide variety of natural and organic herbal medicinal supplements and natural consumer products for local and export markets. FAME also provides high quality raw plant materials for both markets.

He found that comprehensive, up-to-the-minute information on where to stay, how to get around, and tourist sites was very difficult to come by, and that even the latest travel books were by their nature out of date in such a fast moving country. 

With this in mind, Go-Myanmar.com offers a wealth of information for all types of visitor. Things are changing fast in Myanmar, from new hotels, to pricing, to the list of areas that are accessible to tourists – so Go-Myanmar.com is continually updated with all the latest information that travellers need to know. 

Go-Myanmar.com has online ticket and car hire booking facilities for domestic travel in Myanmar, as well as customisable tour booking, and a dedicated section for Business Travel. New features and services will be added regularly as the site develops.

Company Overview: Hintha Business Centres is named after the Hintha (or Hamsa) bird, a symbol of Bago city, a former capital of Myanmar.  Mythology has it that two Hintha birds flying during a flood could only find one dry rock poking above the flood waters on which to rest.  So the male bird landed on the rock, and allowed the female to land and rest on his back until the flood water subsided.   The imagery of the two ‘partner’ birds, one supporting the other, mirrors our values in seeking to support new business entering the Myanmar market.

Hintha Business Centres is part of Anthem Asia, an experienced private investment group dedicated to building and supporting sustainable local businesses in Myanmar.

This flag ship Executive Serviced Centre at 608 Merchant Street, is located in the very heart of downtown Yangon and incorporates the core values that lie at the heart of Anthem Asia – global reach, international standards, local inspiration and authentic, flexible partnership.

 Air Bagan started adopting the Safety Management System (SMS) recommended by ICAO as early as 2006. This recommended SMS was declared MANDATORY for all Myanmar AOC holders by Myanmar Department of Civil Aviation on 01/07/2010.
Adopting and practising SMS will not stop mistakes. However, it will recognize that human error is inevitable and attempts to put defenses in place for these inevitable errors before they occur. Where the SMS does not prevent an incident or accident, the SMS will capture the lessons learnt from that event and improve itself. Air Bagan will further enhance the safety standards through training standard and better training programmes.
 In conjunction with adopting safety enhancement capability, Air Bagan, since  March 2012 had started using e-ticketing system and it is the first domestic airline in Myanmar to use Computerised Reservation System. Furthermore, we are currently in the process of opening up Distribution Channels enabling Online Bookings via internet with Global Distribution System and Amadeus System for Air Bagan’s domestic route network. We expect to introduce this service shortly.
Besides offering unrivalled air transport services to our passengers, Air Bagan also provide social services in the form of charities and donations during natural disasters, to orphanages, and other social and health care requirements in conjunction with Htoo Foundation.
 I would again like to express my sincere thanks on behalf of Air Bagan to all our passengers and travel agents who always have maintained their support over our 8 years of operation and still continuing.

Address 2: Happy Valley
Date Added: 06-14-2015
Company Description:The Origin of Hong Kong Horse Racing
Horse racing in Hong Kong commenced in 1841 with the arrival of the British, who immediately set about draining a malarial swamp to form a racetrack at Happy Valley. With the exception of a few years during World War II, the track has seen non-stop action ever since. The Hong Kong Jockey Club was founded in 1884 and changed from an amateur to a professional organisation in 1971. A second racecourse was opened at Sha Tin in 1978.
The growth of the sport's popularity was attended by an increase in illegal bookmaking. In 1973, the Government authorised the Club to operate off-course betting branches to tackle illegal gambling head-on. Since then, the Mark Six lottery and regulated football betting have also been introduced to combat illegal gambling.
The Club has a long tradition of donating to charitable causes, but it was in the 1950s, as Hong Kong struggled to cope with post-war reconstruction and a massive influx of immigrants, that this role became integral to its operation. In 1955 the Club formally decided to devote its surplus each year to charity and community projects.

Company Overview: Cigars...""The cigar is a great resource. It is necessary to have traveled for a long time on a ship to understand that at least the cigar affords you the pleasure of smoking. It raises your spirits. Are you troubled by something? The cigar dissolves it. Are you subject to aches and pains (or bad temper)? The cigar will change your disposition. Are you harassed by unpleasant thoughts? Smoking a cigar puts one in a frame of mind to dispense with these. Do you ever feel a little faint from hunger? A cigar satisfies the yearning. If you are obsessed by sad thoughts, a cigar will take your mind off of them.""

Company Overview: The World Food Programme is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.

In emergencies, we get food to where it is needed, saving the lives of victims of war, civil conflict and natural disasters. After the cause of an emergency has passed, we use food to help communities rebuild their shattered lives.

WFP is part of the United Nations system and is voluntarily funded.

Born in 1961, WFP pursues a vision of the world in which every man, woman and child has access at all times to the food needed for an active and healthy life. We work towards that vision with our sister UN agencies in Rome -- the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) -- as well as other government, UN and NGO partners.

On average, WFP reaches more than 80 million people with food assistance in 75 countries each year. About 11,500 people work for the organization, most of them in remote areas, directly serving the hungry poor. 

To learn more, watch the video outlining our mission, read our Mission Statement and our 2013 Annual Performance Report or download the Infographic.

Company Overview: SLADE PROPERTY SERVICES
A NAME IN REAL ESTATE BUSINESS

Slade Property Services (Myanmar) Ltd is a privately owned real estate advisory company that specialises in commercial real estate in Yangon, Myanmar. The company was incorporated in March 2014 and is owned by Slade Property Services (Asia) Pte Ltd, a company that was incorporated in Singapore in July 2013.

MARKET OVERVIEW
The Yangon real estate market is going through a serious alteration from one dominated by low level, poorly maintained commercial buildings to newly refurbished or newly developed office, retail, hotel and industrial real estate. The market is still drastically undersupplied in all sectors, including residential, and cannot cater for the large volume of demand from local and overseas companies. This has caused a serious rental increase with commercial space now more expensive than major developed markets such as New York, Hong Kong and London. With demand forecasted to continue to grow, a significant amount of international grade commercial space is needed in order to curb the unsustainable rental levels and house the large volume of companies that are establishing operations in the city.

Company Overview: The KT Group is a private, family owned and operated diversified business enterprise which was established in the 1950’s. We have grown into a modern Myanmar company that embraces the opportunities for growth but also remembers our deep history and holds respect for the country and her people.

The founding family members of the KT Group were the Kyaw Thaung family from Thekathaung, a town located on Ngapudaw Island deep in the Delta area of Myanmar. From humble origins, U Kyaw Thaung traveled to the capital, Yangon and began trading within the region. This prosperous enterprise based in Yangon was grown and began trading rice and pulses to neighbouring countries and securing regional supply contracts. The business then expanded over the years and the company was awarded a Pioneer Status in Singapore in the early 90’s.
GroupPhotoIn 2007, the business was expanded further and established branches in Bangalore, India and Kunming, China to attract foreign investment into the country. Projects included the provision of the cable needed for internet services, real estate development, am rice mill and other interesting and diversified projects. As the company grew, the portfolio of interests began to build momentum in the areas of energy, real estate, trading and investments along with the established traditional roots in the agricultural sector. These have become our core business units of strategic focus, as we continue to build a strong yet diversified group of companies.
We have a rich Myanmar heritage and value our communities and people. Our foundation, KT Care was established i

Company Description:In the early 11rd Century, much earlier than the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, King Anawrahta unified the country and founded the First Myanmar Empire.It was in essence the Bagan Empire which covered areas of the present-day Myanmar and the entire Menam valley in Thailand and lasted two Centuries.
As one of the richest archaeoligical sites in Asia, it is a sprawling cultural treasure trove, majestic and awe-inspiring. Legend puts the number of edifices at around four million, but that would be too much of an exaggeration. Four thousand would be a moderate estimate, or 2,000 more realistic, the number that is being restored in their original style and grandeur.
To much the ancient cultural wealth, devotees have lavished funds to prevent the ruins from vanishing, and be it sunrise, or sunset over the Ayeyawady, Bagan offers the ultimate. A modern touch is added by the numerous inns and hotels, and ' Ruby True ' is no exception, for it lends individuality with all modern conveniences to satiate even the most fastidious, yet with a moderate price tagged for money's worth.

AAPA maintains a permanent secretariat based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, led by the Director General who reports through the Executive Committee to the Assembly of Presidents.

In addition, AAPA retains access to specialised legal and aviation consultants in Brussels and Washington, a reflection of the significant impact which the profusion of US and EU regulatory developments have on all international carriers including Asia Pacific airlines.

AAPA is run as a not-for-profit association, and is fully funded through annual membership subscriptions, based on an agreed formula which reflects the relative sizes of member airlines in terms of their regional traffic volumes.

Twenty years in Myanmar
SPA Myanmar was founded in 1991, when a group of like-minded colleagues joined me to establish our first business venture. We shared a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve and had a bold plan of how to achieve it, and thus, Serge Pun & Associates (Myanmar) Ltd. was born. One year later we founded First Myanmar Investment Co., Ltd. (FMI), one of Myanmar’s earliest public companies, which has since become our flagship brand.
From these small beginnings, our Group has expanded over the years and, at the end of our second decade, we now operate a range of diverse businesses in seven key sectors – Financial Services, Real Estate, Services, Agriculture, Automobiles, Manufacturing & Trading and Retail.
Changing times
As the country moves forward towards a new era of political, social and economic development, the Group will strive to ride with the changing landscape and grow from strength to strength. We are at present focusing our resources on our core businesses while never losing sight of the many opportunities that a diversified business presents. We are expanding our partnerships with international firms of great repute to bring skills and experience to help Myanmar as it transforms and emerges onto the world stage.
SPA Myanmar is ready for any challenges that may come its way. We are confident that with our experience in various industries, as well as our strategic thinking, our professionalism, and our core of dedicated personnel, we are well-positioned for further successes well into the future.

Company Description:The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is changing. The ASEAN Charter introduced a new brand for the Association. The Charter sets out the norms of behavior for member states in relating to their citizens and formalizes ASEANâ€™s commitment to democracy, human rights, rule of law, good governance, constitutional government and social justice. Together with the Road Map of Community Building 2009-2015, ASEAN aims at performing in a more transparent, accountable, efficient, predictable, responsive and people-oriented way.

It is worth noting that the establishment of ASEAN Community is not merely about political process, instead, it is also a social process. Thus, the establishment of ASEAN Community would not be successful only through number of declaration, resolution, or charter, which were top-down in nature. It should involve social interaction among the peoples of the region.

As result of the Charter, ASEAN promote the role of Civil Society in building ASEAN Community and ASEAN leaders listen the voice of Civil Society Groups for making people-centered ASEAN as the ASEAN charter describe. Therefore, the Civil Society Group organized ASEAN People Forum/ ASEAN Civil Society Conference in every year at the host country of ASEAN Chairmanship.

Myanmar Civil Society Group, as preparation of APF/ACSC, has founded Myanmar People Forum Working Group in October, 2011 and planned to organize Myanmar People Forums with local NGOs and Civil Society Groups all over the country. To organize APF/ACSC effectively and successfully in 2014 with all Local NGOs and Civil Society Groups as well as Other NGOs and CSOs from other ASEAN member countries, MPFWG is organizing workshops, forums and knowledge Sharing Session about ASEAN and APF/ACSC.

For this year, Civil Society in Cambodia organized ASEAN People Forum/ ASEAN Civil Society two times and the first time was March 29th, 30th, 31th and the second time will be on November 14th, 15th, 16th. For the second APF/ACSC meeting, 15 representatives from Myanmar People Forum Working Group and 5 representatives from Myanmar Youth Forum Working Group will be attending and discussed about Myanmar related issues and concerns in the regional forum.

It is therefore the focus of this proposal for raising the fund to travel to Phnom Penh for 20 representatives of Myanmar People Forum Working Group and Myanmar Youth Forum Working Group. Prior to the travel to Cambodia, we have arrange one advocacy trip to Nay Pyi Daw to meet the Ministry of Foreign Affair and one day workshop for members of delegation about ASEAN and APF/ACSC.

Vision:

To be able to manage an effective and efficient ASEAN people forum in 2014
To build permanent civil society platform which encompassed diverse civil society organizations, groups and network all over the country.

Mission Statement:

To organize effective People Forum which link to ASEAN People Forum
To select the civil society delegation for representing Myanmar Civil Society group at APF
To raise people related issues at Myanmar People Forum and find recommendations as well as bringing these issues to APF/ACSC
To follow up the development, actions points of the previous APF

Objectives:

Company Description:Mingalarbar!

Our airline has entered the airtransport market in Myanmar at a time of unprecedented changes in the country. Since its election in 2010, our present government has been implementing wide-ranging social, economic and political reforms which have earned the acclaim of the international community.

Myanmar's re-entry into the global family has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of leisure and business visitors by air which means that the country's airline industry needs to expand in order to accommodate the influx of international travelers. Whereas in the past, Yangon was the only gateway to Myanmar by air, recent bilateral and regional air transport liberalisation measures, together with our domestic policies for development of tourism and commerce, have made other major airports accessible by international air carriers. Of these, the most important is the Mandalay International Airport to which regional carriers, namely / China Eastern Airlines, Thai AirAsia, Thai Smile and Bangkok Airways, are operating presently from Kunming and Bangkok. In addition, our national carrier, Myanmar Airways International, is operating between Mandalay and Gaya. It is highly anticipated that more international and regional carriers will be operating to Mandalay in the near future, for Mandalay is the cultural centre of Myanmar and is in close proximity to two of the main tourist destinations, Bagan and Inle Lake (via Heho), as well as to our administrative capital Nay Pyi Taw. Such is the reason that Mann Yadanarpon Airlines (MYP) has decided to base its operations at Mandalay International Airport so as to facilitate the travelling needs of international visitors to Myanmar by linking Mandalay to all the main domestic destinations.

Apart from international travellers, our airline's wide domestic network will also offer domestic travellers a convenient choice for air travel. Our airline will strive to give full satisfaction to all our customers and gradually establish a strong market presence enabling us to contribute to our country's social and economic development.

Please enjoy your flight on Mann Yadanarpon Airlines!

Company Description:I am happy to report that we are steadily progressing with our conglomerate approach to building a diversified portfolio of businesses in Myanmar. As the country continues its rapid pace of development, Yoma Strategic is well placed to participate in this growth momentum, both in terms of our core businesses as well as in new business endeavours. We had another year of solid performance for the financial year ended 31 March 2014 (“FY2014”). 

Myanmar’s progress provided us with exciting opportunities and its fair share of challenges. Our nascent democracy, though laudable, had its dose of labour pains. The country’s weak infrastructure continues to be an impediment to faster growth and efficiency. In the sectors of power generation, financial services, transportation and telecommunications, these deficiencies are particularly evident and are in need of immediate attention. It is however equally evident that the incumbent Government has been working as fast as it can to overcome these obstacles to development. 

As ‘hard’ infrastracture is being upgraded, ‘soft’ infrastructure such as the promulgation of legislation, adherence to the rule of law, implementation of responsible business practices and augmentation of our human capital will prove to be key elements to Myanmar’s development. As we embark down the road of reform, progress and development, the success of the Government’s plans for inclusiveness, social equality and alleviation of poverty will become important factors on how the country chooses to define itself.

Date Added: 06-15-2015
Company Description:Japanese truck maker Hino Motors has opened two service centres in Yangon and Mandalay.

Takahiko Taniyama, managing director of Summit SPA Motors Limited, said that most of the Hino vehicles in Myanmar are old and require maintenance, so mechanical maintenance will be provided initially followed by cosmetic maintenance.

Hino is currently working to import their products directly to Myanmar.

Transport minister U Aung Khin said, “Hino vehicles are widely used in Myanmar in military, trade and transportation sectors. The locals may acquire technical knowledge and employment opportunities because the service centres will provide service in accordance with Japanese standards. Furthermore, it is more beneficial for us as the spare parts can be available locally.”

The service centres will use Japanese technology and local employees will be sent to Japan to improve their competence and technical skills, Takahiko said. Japanese technicians will also come to Myanmar and provide trainings three times a year, he added.

In addition to Yangon and Mandalay, services will be provided to rural and remote locations, the company said. The workforce currently consists of 27 people in Yangon and 10 in Mandalay.

The site in Yangon covers around 12,000 square metres, making it one of the largest service centres for commercial vehicles in the country. It is a 60-40 joint venture between Japanese trading house Sumitomo and local conglomerate Surge Pun and Associates (SPA). Several hundred million yen will be invested in the site, according to Japanese media reports.

Myanmar started importing Hino vehicles, mainly container trucks and buses, back in 1954. Together with the government, manufacturing facilities were set up in Htonebo town in Bago region and Yangon in 1965, and manufacturing continued until 1989. The company sold over 20,000 vehicles over the last 30 years.

Company Overview: ABOUT THE WINERY

Bob and Glen are cousins - both having a big interest in wine making. More than fifteen years ago, they were discussing their favorite hobby (over a glass of wine) and the idea of throwing in together and building a winery was born. There were no vines, no land, and no buildings - just an idea that maintained itself for several years, an idea that was shared by their wives, Debbie and Rolayne.

Land in Oriental was purchased in 2000 and the idea began to come into fruition. In 2003, Glen retired from his teaching career of thirty-one years and had a house and winery building built.

Prayers were said, the first 300 vines went into the ground, and the Neuse River Winery was born in 2004. Every year, more vines were added, the inside of the winery building was fleshed out to hold a processing room and a wine tasting room. Since the grape vines do not bear fruit their first few seasons, no wine was sold, but as more and more vines started to produce, limited amounts of wine could be made.

Right now, we have seven wines to offer: Norton, a dry red (aka “Cab of the Ozarks”), a dry white called Villard Blanc (reminiscent of Riesling but fuller bodied), Chardonel (a cross of Chardonnay and Seyval grapes),sweet Blueberry, off dry Blackberry, and Mead (honey wine, sweet). We plan to enlarge that list as more grape vines start producing.

We hope not to be a regular winery selling only grape wine, but to be more artisanal in our approach to wine making by combining grape wine with fruit wine and/or with spices. That doesn’t mean we won’t have pure grape wine. How about cranberry infused mead or Norton mixed with Blueberry wine?

Since all of our wines are hand wrought, we can make no guarantee that the wine of this year will be identical to the wine of the next season. We make wines by the small batch - forty gallons or so at a time instead of forty thousand gallons at a time as do the “Industrial” wine makers.

When all is said and done - We hope you’ll enjoy the wine!

Company Description:Greetings from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA).

Since 1962, KOTRA has helped Korea become one of the world’s largest trading nations through supporting the overseas expansion of Korean companies and paving the way for new export markets. We have also promoted foreign direct investment in Korea and supported the growth of foreign investors in our country.
Today, in a global business environment that poses its share of challenges due to the tapering of quantitative easing in the United States, the recession in Europe and the low Japanese yen, KOTRA continues to support partnerships and cooperation between Korean and foreign companies. We aim to increase trade in such new fields as cultural contents, services, medical goods & services and new energy. And we will continue to provide comprehensive support for both Korea’s inbound and outbound foreign direct investment.
Of course, KOTRA will also help companies make the most of Korea’s expansive free trade network. We have free trade agreements with the world’s three largest markets – the United States, EU and China – and other countries, which means you can access 73.5 percent of the global economy through Korea.
With 123 offices in 83 countries, we are here to serve as your global business platform. Our goal is to contribute to the economic growth not only of Korea, but also of developing countries through sharing about our development experiences and being a socially responsible corporation.
It is my hope that you will join us on this journey of shared growth and prosperity.
Sincerely,
CEO Sign

In emergencies, we get food to where it is needed, saving the lives of victims of war, civil conflict and natural disasters. After the cause of an emergency has passed, we use food to help communities rebuild their shattered lives.

WFP is part of the United Nations system and is voluntarily funded.

Born in 1961, WFP pursues a vision of the world in which every man, woman and child has access at all times to the food needed for an active and healthy life. We work towards that vision with our sister UN agencies in Rome -- the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) -- as well as other government, UN and NGO partners.

On average, WFP reaches more than 80 million people with food assistance in 75 countries each year. About 11,500 people work for the organization, most of them in remote areas, directly serving the hungry poor.

Company Description:The first Myanmar Women’s Forum, jointly organized by the Women’s Organizations Network (WON) and the Women’s League of Burma (WLB), was successfully held in Excel Treasure Hotel, Bahan, Yangon from 20th-22nd September 2013. Over 400 participants attended the forum; made up of a diversity of ethnic women from State and Regionally based women’s organizations, foreign and border based women’s organizations, political parties, female MPs, civil society organizations and individuals.

The three-day forum included presentations and workshops on ‘legal protection for women’; ‘women and decision-making’; ‘women and peace’; ‘the constitution, federalism and women’ and finally ‘gender equality’.

During Myanmar’s democratic transition period, this is the first forum held with cooperation from ethnic women from inside and outside the country and borderland areas, with the aim to promote women’s empowerment, equality and their involvement in Myanmar’s peace and federalization process.

Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe, a member of the steering committee of the Women’s Organization Network (WON-Myanmar), said, “It is important that women take up leadership roles in the peace process. At the same time, there is an urgent need to bring justice to women who suffered from wars and to cure their resulting trauma.”

Ma Tin Tin Nyo, the general secretary of the Women’s League of Burma (WLB), said “When we work for gender equality, the government has the responsibility to create conditions that would ensure practical applications through behavioral and cognitive changes in individuals.”

Daw Shwe Shwe Sein Lat, another member of WON- Myanmar’s steering committee also said, “In order for women to take political leadership roles, there is a need to put in place specific legal provisions.”

Saw San Nyein Thu, a patrons of the Women’s League of Burma (Myanmar), also said, “Currently, women have been suffering from sexual harassment and violence at the domestic level, community level and state level. To ensure the promotion of women’s life and equality, and to ensure the legal protection of women, the current 2008 constitution needs to be reviewed and amended in accordance with the CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of Violence Against Women).”

We will shortly release a statement with the points agreed during the forum.

The women representatives who attended will send a signed petition to the President for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Naw Ohn Hla, Daw Bau Ja, Daw Mi Mi Khine and Daw Myint Myint Aye, who are both human right defenders and gender activists.

Company Description:About FocusCore
Companies succeed when they stay focused on their core business. Yet it’s easy become sidetracked by non-essential tasks that divert energy from the basic corporate mission.

 

FocusCore is here to help.

 

We’re a business services advisory company with a very specific purpose. We provide business resources and advice that support an array of administrative and other non-core functions. By entrusting some of these functions to us, our clients are able to align resources – especially people – around their most strategically vital business tasks.

 

You could say our core business is helping you focus on yours. FocusCore provides business support services in three key functional areas: recruiting, business-entry and business process outsourcing. All three require deep local knowledge and connections that international companies operating in Asia may lack.

Company Description:Monroe Consulting Group first started offering executive search (headhunting) services in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2003 and is recognised as one of the leading permanent recruitment agencies in Thailand. From Monroe’s headquarters in Bangkok, the Company’s specialist executive search teams track the best talent in the market in the consumer goods, health, industrial, professional and technology industries.

With a population of more than 68 million, Thailand is the second largest economy (behind Indonesia) in the Asean group of countries. Ranked 31st in the world for competitiveness, Thailand’s economy is dominated by manufacturing (accounting for 33 percent of GDP), closely followed by the services sectors (tourism, real estate, healthcare, financial services and trading) and finally agriculture. Thailand’s GDP has grown steadily over the last 15 years, averaging a 4.2 percent increase year-on-year, which has led to it having one of the lowest unemployment rates in the word (currently at 0.7 percent). This very low unemployment rate coupled with more and more companies using Thailand as their Asean base has put a premium on highly skilled and managerial level talent.

The premium on highly skilled professionals means that having a well-connected executive search (headhunting) partner is essential. Monroe Consulting Group’s ability to complement its database search technics with advanced levels of executive search (headhunting) means the Company is well placed to deliver a full 360° service that offers both clients and candidates an in-depth and particularly well-rounded recruitment service.

With its deep understanding and wide business networks in Bangkok and Thailand, Monroe Consulting Group is well positioned to deliver the best talent to its clients.

Defining our divisions by Industry facilitates the growth of essential business contacts and professional networks that open up the necessary channels to identify the highest performing professionals in the market, which as made is the preferred executive search recruitment partner by many of the leading companies in the world.

a team of ten international and local planners, architects and
economists to help the Yangon City Development Committee
(YCDC) and the Yangon Heritage Trust (YHT) define an
investment programme for a comprehensive heritage-led
regeneration initiative in selected pilot areas in the city’s
historic core.
This investment programme will map out opportunities and
constraints for upgrading of historic properties and public
space and infrastructure improvements. The aim is to provide
a feasible development alternative that is more respectful to
the historic fabric and also provides more acceptable and
affordable alternatives to residents compared to the common
current practice of demolition and new build development.
The team will explore potential models to generate investment
beyond individual buildings as a basis for further upgrading of
the urban environment in downtown Yangon. This will
showcase how heritage conservation and development can
work hand in hand to for a vibrant and viable urban future.

Company Overview: OT’s core business for the past 30 years has always been about developing security software embedded in objects mostly in the Payment, Telecommunications and Identity markets. In the past few years, our environment has been disrupted by the explosion in mobility. Mobility has become a way of life and creates an opportunity for us to develop and manage new security solutions to protect the digital assets of our customers and their end-users.

The mobility conceived by OT must be accessible to everyone, everywhere. It not only requires convergence between device manufacturers, mobile operators, banks and service providers, but also a strong presence from digital security players. OT is one of the only companies capable of proposing the most robust security solutions possible for all stakeholders, which at the same time remain transparent and user-friendly for consumers enabling individuals and data to go mobile as safely and reliably as possible.

At OT we aim at facilitating and securing mobility to ensure we can all benefit from the present and future opportunities opened up by new technologies: a faster, more convenient, more connected mobile life, with maximum protection of digital assets.

On the back of this, our ambition is to become the undisputed world leader in digital security solutions for the mobility space.

Company Overview: AVIAREPS was founded in Germany in 1994 with the aim of meeting the growing demands of the aviation and tourism representation market.  While airlines dominated our radar screen in the beginning, what we quickly learned was that other segments of the tourism industry, such as tourist promotion boards, hotel chains, cruise lines, car rental agencies, airports and attractions, were also looking for the unique global marketing network that we provide. Today, the AVIAREPS Group is the world's leading tourism and airline sales and marketing company with over 90 airlines and 90 tourism accounts in its client portfolio.

In addition, the AVIAREPS Group has a rapidly growing Trade & Retail promotion division to represent cities, states, nations, retailers, and trade associations seeking to boost trade flows from around the world. Supplementing these core businesses, clients seeking international marketing support also tap into our other major divisions -- public relations, advertising, IT solutions and financial services.

In contrast to all other global sales and marketing competitors, AVIAREPS has established a worldwide network of self-owned offices totaling over 50 offices worldwide, ensuring pinpoint market access for our clients and local AVIAREPS teams on the ground in all key markets around the world ready to act on your behalf.

Company Overview: UN-Habitat is the United Nations programme working towards a better urban future. Its mission is to promote socially and environmentally sustainable human settlements development and the achievement of adequate shelter for all.

Cities are facing unprecedented demographic, environmental, economic, social and spatial challenges. There has been a phenomenal shift towards urbanization, with 6 out of every 10 people in the world expected to reside in urban areas by 2030. Over 90 per cent of this growth will take place in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

In the absence of effective urban planning, the consequences of this rapid urbanization will be dramatic. In many places around the world, the effects can already be felt: lack of proper housing and growth of slums, inadequate and out-dated infrastructure – be it roads, public transport, water, sanitation, or electricity – escalating poverty and unemployment, safety and crime problems, pollution and health issues, as well as poorly managed natural or man-made disasters and other catastrophes due to the effects of climate change.

Mindsets, policies, and approaches towards urbanization need to change in order for the growth of cities and urban areas to be turned into opportunities that will leave nobody behind.

UN-Habitat, the United Nations programme for human settlements, is at the helm of that change, assuming a natural leadership and catalytic role in urban matters. Mandated by the UN General Assembly in 1978 to address the issues of urban growth, it is a knowledgeable institution on urban development processes, and understands the aspirations of cities and their residents.

For close to forty years, UN-Habitat has been working in human settlements throughout the world, focusing on building a brighter future for villages, towns, and cities of all sizes. Because of these four decades of extensive experience, from the highest levels of policy to a range of specific technical issues, UN-Habitat has gained a unique and a universally acknowledged expertise in all things urban.

This has placed UN-Habitat in the best position to provide answers and achievable solutions to the current challenges faced by our cities. UN-Habitat is capitalizing on its experience and position to work with partners in order to formulate the urban vision of tomorrow. It works to ensure that cities become inclusive and affordable drivers of economic growth and social development.

Company Overview: Bespoke skincare born of a doctor’s experience

DrGL® is a range of bespoke skincare by celebrity Dr Georgia Lee. The proprietary skincare range infuses science into effective skincare and is dedicated to different skin types. Eschewing the mass for a carefully crafted selection of premium quality products, DrGL® offers the modern busy individual maximum efficacy, minimum fuss.

While her clinical experience gave her the confidence to start her very own skincare line, it was her personal experience that provided the final push. A serious allergic reaction resulted in blisters that covered the left side of her face, leaving her with persistent hyperpigmentation which only resolved after treatment with a cream that she customized for herself. While traumatic, this episode piqued her interest in skincare and motivated her to delve further into its development.

Uncompromising quality

As a boutique brand, Dr Lee is involved at every stage of DrGL® product development, from formula to manufacturing and packaging, always striving for the highest standards.

Never one to settle for less than the best, Dr Lee brings this same demanding approach to DrGL®. Maximum efficacy is ensured with the use of top-of-the-range ingredients, a choice that surprised even her suppliers who advised that cheaper mass alternatives could provide almost the same effects; but for Dr Lee, almost is simply not good enough. Similarly, manufacturers of the same mindset were sought, ensuring that the purity of the products is never compromised at any stage.

A cult favorite in the making

Most gratifyingly, DrGL® has received rave reviews and more importantly, has made a difference to its users. Since its inception, DrGL® skincare has won critical acclaim and recognition. Discover for yourself why fans swear by it.

After this, a group of Thai people and high-ranking officials came together and established the first Thai-operated life insurance company on the 22nd of January 1942, under the name “Thai Life Insurance Company Limited”. It is first life insurance company built by Thai people intended to provide financial security and stability for Thai families. The company's first board of directors were:

6. Mr. Lo-Tek-Chuan Bulsook
7. Mr. Tan-Jin-Keng
8. Mr. Chaweng Kiangsiri
9. Mr. Tan-Kiak-Bun
The company later received the license to engage in the insurance business from Ministry of Finance on the 23rd of March 1942 and had set up the first Board of Executive Directors to operate the organization including:

At first, the life insurance was not very popular; however after the Insurance Division was established under The Ministry of Commerce and Communications in 1929, the life insurance industry became extensively known and several other foreign life insurance companies came to operate in Thailand. In 1942, during the Second World War, a group of Thai people established the first Thai-operated life insurance company.

Sandanila seeks to bring the best of international practice in the areas of corporate governance and transparency into Myanmar and to help attract sustainable, long term capital to assist the ongoing development of the country of Myanmar.
Who We Are Not

Sandanila is not a Private Equity Firm or Fund and is therefore under no pressure to divest any of its investments due to artificial time horizons common with funds.
Sandanila is not focused on short term gains made from the quick flipping of investments, preferring to take a longer term time horizon.
Sandanila is not unduly focused on financial engineering, preferring to create value through smart strategic choices and operational improvements.

Date Added: 10-07-2015
Status: Qualified Lead
Ownership: Private
Company Overview: French cement giant Lafarge has opened a cement repacking and storing factory in Thilawa special economic zone (SEZ) in Myanmar.

Lafarge, one of the world’s largest building materials firm with over €15 billion in revenues, and two local companies – Aung Myin Thu and My Associates – have built the factory with an estimated investment of $10-20 million, company officials said.

Lafarge owns 60 percent of the distribution depot, while the two local firms own 20 percent each.

The depot, which is near Thilawa port, 20 kilometres outside Yangon, can store 20,000 tonnes of cement and will be able to expand capacity based on customer demand, U Hla Myo, managing director of Aung Myin Thu, told Myanmar Business Today.

Lafarge has been present in Myanmar since 1999 through its local subsidiary Thilawa Cement and Building Materials Ltd (TCBM). It planned to build a factory in Thilawa earlier in 2000 but the plans were mothballed due to European Union (EU) sanctions against Myanmar. Lafarge recently opened the capital of TCBM to local partners and created the joint venture.

The new depot will mainly be used for repacking and storing cement, while the cement will be imported in bulk from Lafarge plants in the region, mainly from Malaysia and Vietnam.

The company will primarily supply its cement to construction projects in the ongoing Japanese-backed Thilawa SEZ project and the rest to the local market.

“We aim to provide good quality cement at affordable prices in Myanmar, and capture about 50 percent of the market in the future,” U Hla Myo said.

The French firm, which has 1,600 factories in 64 countries and a global workforce of 68,000, said it will hire 150 employees in Myanmar and train them to Lafarge standards, while also focusing on asset revamping, new equipment installation and reintroducing its Lafarge Star brand in the market.

Surging demand

Lafarge said it is planning to invest $400-500 million more in the future as it predicts Myanmar’s demand for building materials to surge.

Cement demand has been growing at a fast pace over the past couple of years in Myanmar following the opening up of the country. The subsequent construction boom has lifted the demand to 6 million tonnes in 2013, according to Lafarge.

The market can be divided in two segments, with the country’s north supplied by local cement producers and the south mainly supplied by imports from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Local production is expected to increase at a high speed in the coming years but imports are also expected to remain important due to the high economic growth.

Overall Myanmar consumption is predicted to grow around 15 percent (compound annual growth rate) in the coming years, fuelled by housing needs in major cities and infrastructure development, Lafarge said.

Myanmar’s construction boom has prompted many foreign cement companies to look closely into the market. Thai cement giant Siam Cement Group (SCG) said it is going to establish a $388-million cement factory near Mawlamyine, Mon state, while Indonesia’s state-run Semen Indonesia said it will build a $200-million cement factory this year.

India-based Ramco Cement, Italian cement major Italcementi and companies from South Korea and China are also eyeing the market. Local firm Young Investment Group (YIG) signed a joint venture agreement this year with American construction firm Holloman Corp to set up Young Holloman Corp, which will build two cement batching plants in Yangon.

Company Overview: CONNECT offers high quality education that demands and improves students’ critical thinking, imagination, and intellectual capacity through a great learning hub. It offers test preparation courses for studying abroad, Bridge Program, American Scholars Program, and International Studies Program.

Our Vision is: More and more Myanmar students to taste and enjoy Western critical education. In Myanmar, education has long been confused with vocational qualities, certificates, or learning of facts. However, we believe that the things that give students critical thinking, imagination, and intellectual capacity are the core of true education. We agree with Einstein that “Education is not the learning of facts but the training of the mind to THINK”.

CONNECT was founded in mid 2014 by two U.S. graduates from Myanmar. One graduated from Scripps College in Mathematical Economics, and the other studied Politics and Economics at Bates College and did a Public Policy Fellowship at Princeton. With their own experiences as students who strived hard to pursue good education, the energetic CONNECT team is committed to delivering valuable learning opportunities for Myanmar students.

Our Market Segment

Each year, thousands of customers choose ‘home credit’ because they want small, affordable loans that can be repaid in fixed, regular amounts. These clients are typically not served by the banks, but they also need financial services. These could also be clients with one or several bank loans, who suddenly may have an unexpected expense and would need some additional money to stabilize their household budget.


Our Product

Easy Credit offers loan amounts of about 650 BGN on average. The amounts are granted for short periods of time – between 8 and 43 weeks that can be repaid by fixed installments, tailored to the financial capabilities of each client. The loan agreement is always totally transparent – what our customers see are what they pay, which allows them to budget and control their finances better.

This is a process which will require substantial investment in the country's infrastructure (telecoms, power and transportation) and to upgrade the logistics and capacity associated with the manufacturing sector and agro-industry. Rekindled consumer demand will require a rapid development of Myanmar's financial services industry and a resurgent tourism industry will require a significant increase in facilities to cope with demand.
 
Myanmar Investments seeks to participate in this exciting journey by acting as a conduit for overseas investors to invest in businesses led by dynamic and visionary Myanmar entrepreneurs, and in some instances will co-invest alongside established international companies.

Company Overview: Ophir Energy is an independent Upstream oil and gas exploration and production company focused on Asia and Africa. Ophir creates value by finding resources and then monetising them at the appropriate time.
Ophir’s vision is to be the leading independent international oil and gas exploration and production company.
Ophir’s model for value creation is through the exploration and appraisal phases of the E&P cycle; and through monetising assets at the appropriate time to capture optimum value for shareholders. Our job is to find resources for the minimal capital outlay and then to monetise them for the highest possible price.
In 2014 we took the decision, in consultation with major shareholders, to move towards sustainability. A key part of this financing model is the addition of production assets which generate cash flow to fund exploration and appraisal activity. The acquisition of Salamander Energy in March 2015 was the first step towards achieving this goal.

Company Overview: Khiri Travel: A Passion for Discovery

Welcome!

The early 1990s was an important time for tourism in the Mekong Region.

Despite infrastructure challenges (very few hotels, bad roads, no regional airline network to speak of, and countries enforcing a lot of visa restrictions) the Mekong River countries were starting to open up to travelers.

I couldn’t have been more excited! Who at that time had set foot in Laos, Cambodia or Vietnam? Khiri Travel was conceived against such a backdrop in 1993. More than 20 years have passed and we’re still only scratching the surface of the travel opportunities that the region has to offer.

It’s been a journey for Khiri Travel too. From a tiny office with a ceiling fan and a fax service down the street, to 16 offices in eight countries, our passion for travel is as strong as ever. I am thankful to friends and long-time partners without whom Khiri Travel wouldn’t be where it is now. As I look around today, we have a great team of specialists in each country. Each one has a unique passion for delivering authentic travel experiences.

Our mission now is to grow Khiri Travel to be the leading brand in quality tourism in Asia — and the champion of the triple bottom line: people, planet, profit. Sustainability is at the basis of all that we do. In December 2013 Khiri Travel received certification by Sustainable Travel International (STI).

Staff members are empowered. Throughout our offices they energetically support Khiri Reach, our charity for people and planet projects in Southeast Asia. We have started to plant trees to make our business travel carbon neutral. We have a long way to go. But we will keep working hard at being a social and environmentally sustainable business.

Enjoy our website! Sign up for our newsletter and blog posts, which are also there to inspire clients, tour operators and travel agents worldwide.

At Khiri Travel we want to share our passion with visitors.  So please join us for the journey ahead.

This is the vision that drove two passionate travelers to establish Myanmar Diaries in 2010 and is the vision that, to this day, is embraced by the guides and team members behind the scenes.

The story began in 2007. Whilst on an independent holiday to Myanmar, Thomas from Germany fell in love with its people, culture and beauty. Beau, a Myanmar native, returned to his homeland around the same time after completing his studies in Australia. Having traveled extensively around Southeast Asia, and living in Cambodia, he returned with fresh eyes and a new appreciation for his country.

In addition to recognizing the allure of the country, the two friends also noticed a huge gap in the tourism sector. Travel agents and guides were sticking to the same itineraries, the same routes and tightly-scheduled programs that did not allow guests to truly ‘feel’ Myanmar. Both Beau and Thomas had experience in the industry and knew what makes an experience good, bad and absolutely incredible and they felt that too many visitors were missing out on an ‘incredible’ holiday.

And thus Myanmar Diaries was born. The two took a risk and jumped in to the fledgling market, developing unique, genuine experiences with highly trained guides, hidden local spots and a network of passionate employees throughout the country. Understanding the value of customer service and flexibility, Beau and Thomas continue to deliver unforgettable tailor-made holidays.

Although the team has grown and the tourism industry has boomed, the ethos of Myanmar Diaries has remained intact. With every new guest, with each new itinerary crafted and with each new day the team at Myanmar Diaries aims to share a truly unique Myanmar experience.

Company Overview: Sandoz, the generic pharmaceuticals division of Novartis, is a worldwide leader in generics. With a history of more than 120 years, Sandoz is a trusted leader with a reputation for exceptional quality. Our strategic and customer-focused approach to developing, producing and marketing high-quality affordable medicines following the loss of patent protection, has successfully made us one of the two largest and most respected generics companies worldwide. Our medicines are already available to 90 percent of people across the world and we are committed to further increasing global access to affordable healthcare.

Our comprehensive global development and production network and worldwide commercial presence are complemented by a wide range of standard and differentiated products covering all stages of the development and production processes, from basic molecules to finished medicines. This combination of specialist expertise and extensive global presence, underpinned by an unwavering commitment to quality, gives us a competitive advantage that clearly sets us apart from the competition.

By offering a broad portfolio of high-quality affordable medicines, Sandoz also contributes to the stability of healthcare systems worldwide, providing significant savings that can be used for the funding of costlier novel therapies, thus encouraging continued pharmaceutical innovation. In this way, Sandoz represents a key pillar of the overall Novartis strategy of offering an all-inclusive range of medicines to patients, physicians and healthcare providers along the entire healthcare spectrum. Novartis is currently the only company with a leading global position in both patent-protected and generic pharmaceuticals, allowing Sandoz to benefit from the cross-divisional flow of specialist technical, clinical and regulatory expertise.A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY GENERICSSandoz offers a broad portfolio of approximately 1 100 high-quality molecules, which ranges from standard generics to complex value-added products. We feel it is important to provide our customers with a diverse product range and breadth in selection, allowing for a true “one stop shop” experience. Our generic products range in complexity from oral solids, gels and patch technologies, to complex injectables, inhalers and state-of-the-art biosimilars, a newly emerging field in which Sandoz is the pioneer and global leader. We are also a leading global provider and producer of essential anti-infective medicines, predominantly antibiotics, while other key product groups include cardiovascular medicines, treatments for central nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal medicines, oncology and respiratory therapies, as well as medications for blood and blood forming organ disorders.A LEADER IN DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AND MEETING CUSTOMER NEEDSSandoz stands out from the competition through its ability to develop and produce complex differentiated products, which by value already comprise well over one third of its portfolio. This differentiated portfolio, which goes well beyond standard generics, is the result of clearly focusing on and understanding our customers – but also even more importantly, anticipating their evolving needs. These value-added products predominantly focus on the biosimilar, oncology injectable and respiratory fields, three key pillars to our strategy of differentiation, where we already have or aspire to a global leadership position. Sandoz’s expertise in these complex products is based on decades of experience, particularly in producing intermediates for third parties, with early successes including the first-ever oral penicillin in 1951 and one of the first recombinant proteins, an interferon, in 1980.THE PIONEER AND GLOBAL LEADER IN BIOSIMILARSLeading the way in the development and production of differentiated generics, Sandoz was also the first company to develop and market follow-on versions of highly complex biopharmaceuticals, becoming a true pioneer and global leader in the field of biosimilars. By offering these complex medicines, we are helping to make quality healthcare affordable for all patients and to slow the increase in escalating global healthcare costs.A GLOBAL PRESENCE AND MINDSET, A LOCAL APPROACHToday, Sandoz is the second-largest and one of the most reputable generics companies in the world, employing approximately 26 500 people across the globe. We have more than ten major global development centers and a worldwide network of more than 30 manufacturing sites, and our products are available in more than 160 countries. While we adopt a global perspective to create synergies and greater value for our patients and stakeholders, we also believe that a local approach is instrumental to delivering them, allowing us to be close to patients, doctors and business partners everywhere in the world.

Company Overview: ABOUT US
Highland Metals Celebrates over 25 years!
“Wire is our passion, and our promise has always been to supply  every orthodontist with Simply Great Wire at affordable prices.”
–Ken Highland
In 1988, Ken Highland started Highland Metals Inc. with a personal mission to offer orthodontists high quality arch wire at affordable prices. Unafraid to take on the challenge of finding a solution to the problems he saw within the orthodontic arch wire industry, Mr. Highland developed and refined a manufacturing process for high quality Nickel Titanium archwires with excellent results: precision drawn NiTi wire that isn’t brittle – and one that doctors could easily bend using their own instruments.
His innovative, no-frills approach to wire-making changed the face (and the teeth) of the orthodontic wire-making industry. NiTi is what we’re famous for. Highland Metals emerged from Ken Highland’s garage and moved to a high quality manufacturing facility, located in San Jose, California, and has since established itself as an industry leader and a trusted source for quality orthodontic wire. Today, tens of thousands of orthodontists all over the world choose Highland Metals wire because it is smooth, strong, easy to work with, and comfortable for their patients.
When the company first started, we only offered one kind of wire. Today, we offer a range of wire alloys; each being engineered to meet demanding standards for specific orthodontic use and treatment.
Since the start of our business, HMI has been committed to continued product improvement and innovation. Highland Metals was the first in the industry to offer NiTi on a Spool, Tri-Ang wire, High Torque NiTi, NiTi V-Notch Archwire and more. After years of testing and refinement, Mr. Highland and his team successfully created our BetaBlue Archwire: a stronger, more reliable, nickel-free titanium alloy than other Beta Titanium products.
Wire is not a sideline for us. Wire is the core of our company; our focus, our passion. Though a lot has changed over the past 25 years, making sure we provide you with superior quality, value, and outstanding customer service are still our top priorities never will. Simply Great Wire is not just a slogan, it’s our promise to every doctor who uses our wire.
We are thankful for all the support Highland Metals has relished over the years, internally and externally, from our amazing staff, to our loyal customers.
High Quality
Our commitment to providing top quality products at reasonable prices mean we spend money on quality control, not fancy packaging. At Highland Metals, every step of the manufacturing process is closely monitored and tested to meet our exact specifications; we don’t accept anything but the absolute best. All HMI wire must pass over 50 quality checks that include force deflection, flatness, workability, shape conformance, elasticity, size, strength, polish, and smoothness. Also, unlike other manufacturers’ products, our wire is never brittle.  You can always rely on Highland Metals for the superior quality that saves you time and money.
Excellent Customer Service
It is our business to make your life easier. Fast, efficient service is just as important as our high quality products. Your time is valuable and our goal is to ship your order within 2 business days. Also, for your most immediate needs and concerns, our friendly, knowledgeable Customer Service Representatives are on hand to answer your call – our reps do not have voice mail so you’ll never get a machine during normal business hours.
Mission Statement
Highland Metals’ mission is to provide patient satisfaction by serving clients, staff, and suppliers with integrity, excellence, teamwork, and wisdom.

Company Overview: n July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly created UN Women, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. In doing so, UN Member States took an historic step in accelerating the Organization’s goals on gender equality and the empowerment of women. The creation of UN Women came about as part of the UN reform agenda, bringing together resources and mandates for greater impact. It merges and builds on the important work of four previously distinct parts of the UN system, which focused exclusively on gender equality and women’s empowerment:

Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW)
International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW)
Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI)
United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)
The main roles of UN Women are:

To support inter-governmental bodies, such as the Commission on the Status of Women, in their formulation of policies, global standards and norms.
To help Member States to implement these standards, standing ready to provide suitable technical and financial support to those countries that request it, and to forge effective partnerships with civil society.
To lead and coordinate the UN system’s work on gender equality as well as promote accountability, including through regular monitoring of system-wide progress.
Meeting the Needs of the World’s Women
Over many decades, the UN has made significant progress in advancing gender equality, including through landmark agreements such as the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Gender equality is not only a basic human right, but its achievement has enormous socio-economic ramifications. Empowering women fuels thriving economies, spurring productivity and growth. Yet gender inequalities remain deeply entrenched in every society. Women lack access to decent work and face occupational segregation and gender wage gaps. They are too often denied access to basic education and health care. Women in all parts of the world suffer violence and discrimination. They are under-represented in political and economic decision-making processes. For many years, the UN has faced serious challenges in its efforts to promote gender equality globally, including inadequate funding and no single recognized driver to direct UN activities on gender equality issues. UN Women was created to address such challenges. It will be a dynamic and strong champion for women and girls, providing them with a powerful voice at the global, regional and local levels. Grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the UN Charter, UN Women, among other issues, works for the:

elimination of discrimination against women and girls;
empowerment of women; and
achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.

Company Overview: Since coming to Myanmar (then known as Burma) for the first time in 1977 I was fascinated. Friendly people, some of the most import-ant archaeological sites in South East Asia and a beautiful country-side make it hard to believe that until very lately the country has been something of an 'insiders' tip'. From the very beginning I had the feeling that Myanmar has great touristic potential that only waits to be discovered. In 1986 I guided my first tour through the country, followed by more than hundred others - private ones as well as for renowned German travel agencies.

In the course of my 'tour leader career' I've worked in India, China and all South East Asian countries but Myanmar always held a special place in my heart. In 1996 I moved from Berlin to Yangon and since then I have lived in Myanmar. During my trips around the country I had ample time to study the tourist trade over here and finally came to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to make use of the knowledge collected over a long time - thus, my first company, Bo-Tree Travel, came into existence. Since then I had the privilege to make the beauty of my host country accessible to thou-sands of clients. I was happy to learn that nearly all of them were fascinated as well as I was decades ago and many of them have been coming back to Myanmar. In 2008 I left Bo-Tree and founded AZURE SKY TOURS together with a new local partner.

Myanmar's culture has fascinated me since my first encounter and it didn't take very long until I developed a keen interest which resulted in am number of books: 1990 I wrote the first one ('Birmanisches Marionettentheater' , published by the author), followed by 'Nelles Guide Myanmar' (together with my friend Helmut Koellner) in 1996 which has been translated into several languages.  Until this very day it is one of the most successful guide books about Myanmar in German and has been revised several times, now in its 10th edition, if I'm not mistaken.

1991 I started to study Burmese at Humboldt University Berlin as its knowledge was indispensable for my next project: a Ph.D. thesis about Burmese puppetry which I finished in 1999 ('Burmesische Marionettenkunst', Hamburg). 'Burmese Puppetry', published in 2006 by White Lotus, Bangkok, was my first book in English. It has since become a standard work. Not too long ago I finished 'How to be a good tour guide in Myanmar' which - I hope - will pass on my experience of more than twenty years to my young colleagues.

We don't see our agency as one among many others - no, our clients have the right to expect special achievements from us! Two examples: in 2004 I accompanied a team from the German STERN magazine that was working on a book about the world religions. Myanmar served as model for Buddhism. During our ten days journey I arranged meetings with Buddhist monks, believers and  scholars. It was one of the best selling editions in the history of the magazine and was subsequently published as a book ('Die sechs Weltreligionen', The six world religions, STERN-Buch, Ullstein Verlag, Berlin 2005).

In December 2006 I accompanied the German director Roman Teufel and his team (rtv-studio) during the shooting of a film ('Myanmar - Journey into a lost era') and I was glad to have the chance to contribute to one of the best movies ever made about Myanmar. It received several awards and has been screened repeatedly in many European countries. (Pls. see the trailer!) In 2014 Roman Teufel made another movie (‘Reise in mein Land’/‘A journey to my country’, in German language) about Rakhine, starring my local business partner, Mrs. Khine Khine.

Since 1990 Myanmar has taken several steps to make itself more attractive for visitors. Visa regulations were simplified and the one-week visa that had been enforced since the 1970s was replaced with a four-week visa (see under visa regulations!). The most important step, however, was the abolition of the governments' monopoly of the tourist trade. Many private companies have been founded since then as a result and got a chance to participate in the tourism trade.  And they seized that chance! Gone are the days when tourists were bunked in rundown hotels accompanied by cockroaches and rats, transported in rickety decade-old coaches and airplanes, plagued by the notorious 'Burma Belly'. Nowadays, the visitors can choose among numerous good restaurants and the country's attractions are connected by modern means of transport. At those destinations the visitors can choose from a wide range of hotels, from budget accommodation to four-star-comfort.

Thanks to the reforms and the abolition of sanctions by major Western powers since the elections of 2010 the travel industry has made good progress in our country. In 2012 the number of tourists exceeded one million visitors for the first time in history. This is a big step forward for Myanmar even though this figure includes a significant number of day tourists in local border traffic. However, looking at the total number of tourists in South East Asia (about hundred million!) Myanmar attracted merely one percent of those visitors who came to SE-Asia in 2012... Malaysia is the leading tourist destination with about 29% of the visitors coming to that country. Thailand comes in a close second with 25%. Lately I hear from clients that it is probably ‘too late’ to visit Myanmar, the best days for a visit being over.  Looking at above mentioned figures, nothing could be more wrong: there are quite a few destinations in Myanmar where the foreign tourist still has the place all to himself... One thing, however, is true: Myanmar has the strongest growth in tourist arrivals in the entire region - from 2011 to 2012 the number of visitors increased by 30%! But isn’t that only normal after the country has been more or less closed for decades? Accordingly, the forecast for Myanmar’s tourism industry is excellent: some expect that up to 7.5 million visitors will visit Myanmar in 2020! The most encouraging fact of these estimates is the number of jobs created in the tourist industry: in 2012 about 300,000 people were employed by hotels, travel agencies, car agencies etc. In 2020 the number is expected to double, according to conservative estimates. More optimistic ones expect up to 1.5 million people working in our industry. Whatever the actual numbers will be in the future: the jobs are most welcome in a country where unemployment is rather high. Please support the charming Burmese people by coming to their country - our country. ‘But isn’t all the money going into the pocket of the government or its cronies?’ I hear from worried would-be tourists. Don’t worry! Most of the former government-owned hotels have been sold to private owners - of course, the new owners aren’t poor people - the latter usually don’t own hotels or airlines, which are in private hands, too (except for Myanmar Airways, which we don’t use).

Please be our guest in Myanmar and we show you the most beautiful country on God’s earth.

A word...
from Dr. Axel Bruns

 













Dear friends, ladies & gentlemen, 
We are happy to represent our new colleague: Mr. Tobias Esche is the new Deputy General Manager of our company. He is a German citizen, speaks Burmese and has written a guide book about Myanmar (in German, see below). He has some work experience in our trade as he has worked for a big travel agency here in Myanmar. Moreover, he has knowledge of the internet (which unfortunately evades me...) and thus will enable us to improve in this sector. Pls. expect some (long overdue) changes in the near future. Furthermore, Mrs. Kyawt Kyawt has been replaced in the reservation department by Mrs. Thaw Thaw (see picture below).

Company Overview: Sathapana Limited was established as a Cambodian non-government organization (NGO) in 1995, under the name of Cambodia Community Building (CCB). CCB had contributed actively in poverty reduction through providing financial support and health education to grass-root people. In 2003, CCB was changed to Cambodia Entrepreneurial Building (CEB) after becoming an official microfinance institution. In 2008, it was finally dubbed as Sathapana Limited, having Reachasey, king of animal as its logo.    

In 2003, Sathapana made a new milestone which obtained a license from the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) to operate as an official microfinance institution. This license has enabled the company to provide broader financial services to customers. After becoming the official microfinance institution, outstanding portfolio of the company had increased significantly. As a result of the remarkable performance of operation process, it received the Financial Transparency Award from the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGPA) in 2006. 

The demand of financial saving has increased, especially from women in rural area, therefore; Sathapana Limited proposed for a Deposit Taking License from NBC. In January 2009, the company achieved its goal and became the very first microfinance institution to obtain this license.

In January 2011, Sathapana Limited was granted a new license, Money Exchange License, from NBC to provide customers with a variety of financial services.

Company Description:The technique known as ""Online Marketing"" in Myanmar is not so common even among the businesses that love to do creative branding due to less number of Internet users comparing to other developing countries. However, since mobile Internet connection are available, it is just a click away for almost everyone in urban area to jump onto Internet. Social media tools become talking ground for everything -- humorous movies to political comments. 
?
We see this as the opportunities for marketers. The fast growing number of users of Internet in Myanmar would give businesses nothing but fascinating opportunity to go further with their branding strategies.

We did research on Myanmar online community, tested it out in various ways and freelanced for online marketing consultancy. Finally, we fulfilled our dreams to found one stop digital marketing agency by fulfilling clients' expectations of their social media marketing needs.

Company Overview: Since 2012, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) has been supporting electoral stakeholders in Myanmar to build a transparent, credible and inclusive electoral system. IFES began work in Myanmar during the April 2012 by-elections through a voter education program with civil society partners that targeted the inclusion of women in the electoral process. In early 2013, IFES began to scale up operations in Myanmar by providing workshops and electoral assessments to the Union Election Commission (UEC).

IFES’ assistance to the UEC expanded further in mid-2013 with the opening of an IFES office in the UEC and the establishment of the UEC Training Center. The Training Center has provided a forum for IFES to hold trainings for UEC staff members from national and sub-national offices and stakeholder meetings that have brought together members of civil society organizations with the UEC to address issues of transparency, accountability and inclusion in the electoral process through constructive and sector strengthening collaborations.

managers and other professionals within the finance industry
WHY QUANTIGIC®
Problem - Correlation:
- Most portfolio managers use the same or similar risk models
- This makes trades more correlated
- When a shop blows up, it drags others with it; e.g., Aug'07 Quant Meltdown

Solution - Diversify:
- Use alternative and customizable risk models
- When evaluating risk models, look at: a) relative performance and b) PNL correlation
- Using different risk models with low PNL correlation allows to increase investment level

Problem - ""One glove fits all"":
- Traditional risk models are not customizable: you don't get to adapt them to your alpha;
- Traditional risk models are not transparent: you don't know how they are computed
- Traditional risk models are not flexible: you don't get updates at your desired frequency

Solution - Customize:
- Use Quantigic® Risk Model source-code solution: perpetual license for $99K, one-time fee
- The secret is out: compute covariance matrix and specific risk for any set of risk factors
- You control: risk factors; universe; output frequency; platform-independent integration

Company Overview: Myanmar is estimated to have a population of around 60 million people and this is expected to grow to a population of around 72 million at the end of 2030.

It is likely that Myanmar will have rapid economic growth (8 percent per annum) driven in the seven key sectors of its economy (Manufacturing, Agriculture, Infrastructure, Energy/Mining, Tourism, Financial Services, and Telecom). Increasing these sectors could more than quadruple the economy size from $45 billion in 2010 to over $200 billion in 2030.

Myanmar stands in 46th place in the world in terms of the proven gas reserves, and due to the estimated number of undiscovered gas reserves, Myanmar could rank much higher in the future.

Company Overview: One College, Many Campuses defines our approach to creating a global family of schools
Dulwich College International (DCI) is a family of schools with five International Schools and two International High School Programmes in Asia.
From the opening of the first school in Shanghai with 26 students in 2003, the group now has over 5,000 students in seven colleges in six cities and three countries with Colleges in Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul, Suzhou, Zhuhai and Singapore. We have students from over 60 nationalities and offer an education based on the English National Curriculum (ENC), enhanced and adapted, for international needs. Each of the Colleges offers IGCSEs and the IB Diploma in Years 12 and 13 or, in our International High School Programmes, A-Levels. In all Colleges the primary language of instruction is English with a dual language approach in Mandarin and English in the international schools. The majority of our students go on to some of the world’s leading universities in the UK, USA and elsewhere.
The group employs over 1,200 people of which more than half are teachers.
DCI schools provide a comprehensive education founded on academic rigour and scholarship complemented by rich and rewarding co-curricular programmes, supplemented by innovative learning partnerships with leading universities and organisations.
We place equal emphasis on our students’ intellectual and personal development, encouraging them to learn from everything they do.
We expect our teachers to inspire students, taking them on a journey of discovery to find where their individual talents lie. We want our students to think and learn independently. We have built on our experience as educators to shape our approach to a wide variety of interests and learning styles. The close collaboration among our Colleges stimulates innovation and encourages an international worldview, which we believe provides students an advantage in the futures they will face.
The result is a community where academic ability is nourished, creativity is valued, diversity celebrated and inspiration is paramount.
Thriving on nearly four hundred years of academic excellence and innovation
The dynamic partnership between Dulwich College in London and the Dulwich College Management International aims to establish the Dulwich College vision in Asia and further afield bringing the best education to students around the world. To find out more about Dulwich College Management International please click here.
Dulwich College was founded in 1619 by Edward Alleyn, renowned Elizabethan and Jacobean actor. It is an academically selective boys’ school in south London attracting boys from the top 15% of the UK academic range. It is one of the UK’s most prestigious independent schools and has the largest overseas network of any British independent school.
Dulwich College is recognised as a pioneer in education. It introduced the Modern Curriculum in the 1880s under the then Master, Canon Carver. It was one of the first to introduce Mandarin Chinese to the curriculum and it was the first of the UK independent schools to open a campus overseas in 1996 in Asia. It is also renowned for the Dulwich Experiment in the Forties and Fifties, which admitted students on a needs-blind basis based on academic ability alone. One of this programme’s most famous products was Eddie George, the local postmaster’s son, who became Governor of the Bank of England. A needs-blind policy exists still with approximately a third of its 1,500 students on bursaries or scholarships.
Dulwich College aims to create an environment which promotes an independent work ethic and encourages all pupils to acquire a love of learning. It is committed to nurturing a supportive community which encourages a sense of social responsibility and spiritual and personal development, ensuring that pupils from a variety of backgrounds can feel secure and equally valued. Ambitions shared by the international schools.

Reminiscent of Eastern Europe after the fall of communism – an area also pioneered by Somers early on - a certain suspicion arose of those fly-by-night commuter businessmen eager to turn a quick profit. A local presence requires a substantial investment and the essence of MBV is to allow businesses to be locally represented without carrying the full financial burden addresses both those concerns.

Date Added: 03-03-2016
Company Description:Started in 1998, M-CRIL came into being in response to the need for an agency that would bring about a standardised assessment of financial performance and highlight the importance of governance and management in running sustainable business models of MFIs. It also responded to the need for MFIs to incorporate systems and processes appropriate to the overall objective of providing financial services to a large number of poor and vulnerable families. M-CRIL plays a key role in the development finance space across its operational area.

The foundation of M-CRIL was laid by EDA Rural Systems Pvt Ltd, M-CRIL’s parent organization which had undertaken value chain analyses, livelihoods assessments, monitoring and evaluation of microenterprise and microfinance programmes for over 15 years throughout Asia. EDA was instrumental in working with microfinance funders (including development banks) and identifying the need for an agency like M-CRIL. 

M-CRIL since its inception has played a pivotal role in the provision of financial services to the poor. With time M-CRIL has diversified itself to a complete knowledge and data center for the microfinance sector. Its regular interest in financial research and assessments helped to evolve its other current service products like Social Rating, portfolio audit, rating of affordable private schools, sector analysis and assessment, financial research and data management. M-CRIL has also undertaken a number of assignments focused on sector advocacy and is a member of national and international networks.

Company Overview: Myanmar, a republic in South-East Asia, bounded on the north by Tibet Autonomous Region of China; on the east by China, Laos, and Thailand; on the south by the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal; and on the west by the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh, and India. It is officially known as the Union of Myanmar. The coastal region is known as Lower Myanmar, while the interior region is known as Upper Myanmar. The total area of the country is 676,552 square km (261,218 square miles).
A horseshoe-shaped mountain complex and the valley of the Ayarwaddy (Irrawaddy) River system are the dominant topographical features of Myanmar. The mountains of the northern margin rise to 5881 meters (19,296 ft) atop Hkakabo Razi, the highest peak in Southeast Asia. The two other mountain systems have northern to southern axes. The Arakan Yoma range, with peaks reaching more than 2740 meters (about 9000 ft), forms a barrier between Myanmar and the subcontinent of India. The Bilauktaung range, the southern extension of the Shan Plateau, lies along the boundary between southwestern Thailand and southeastern Lower Myanmar. The Shan Plateau, originating in China, has an average elevation of about 910 meters (about 3000 ft).
Generally narrow and elongated in the interior, the central lowlands attain a width of about 320km (about 200 miles) across the Ayarwaddy-Sittaung delta. The delta plains, extremely fertile and economically the most important section of the country, cover an area of about 46,620 sq. km (18,000 sq. ml.). Both the Arakan (in the northwest) and the Tenasserim (in the southwest) coasts of myanmar are rocky and fringed with islands. The country has a number of excellent natural harbours.

Company Overview: Sustainable Teak – to help protect the teak forest Myanmar /Burma, BOF only uses and purchase teak obtained from M.T.E (Myanma Timber Enterprise – sole seller of teak / hardwood logs in Myanmar), legally with official documents from source to entry to our factory / the documents are carefully monitored and documented right through from factory to port of Yangon in sealed containers. Our customers are provided with copies of original authentic verified export documents to prove its legality with official permits for export.

On the environmental side, Myanmar Ministry of Forestry only harvest commercial species such as Teak, Pyinkado and Kanyin and the lesser known species are left to grow of all old growth trees. Only elephants are used to extract logs for transport so the forest is not destroyed. AAC – annual allowable cut, only trees that meets the minimum diameter is harvested. Most importantly, Harvest areas are only done every 30 years and left to re-generate naturally, instead of “cut and burn” to become plantation such as for palm oil plantation.

Utlization – BOF uses every part of the teak log by making decking, flooring, furniture, household items and nothing is wasted. For parts that cannot be used or off- cuts are turned into finger joint for inner core for engineered products such as flooring and doors.

Company Description:At their deepest, BG roots took hold in the difficult days of World War II. The seven founders of BG Products emerged from that war with their characters affirmed, their courage and vision proven. They set about the accumulation of 175 years of collective experience in the petrochemical industry before coming together in 1971, to form— out of collective necessity—a new company based on automotive products of superior quality and, even more, on the contributions of people working together in a common cause of personal and professional excellence.

In November, 1971, the partners took BG first two products to market: Engine Tune-Up and RF-7. The first truckload—40,000 pounds of the only two products available— left Wichita for a distributorship of founder in North Carolina. In our first full year in business, BG sold products worth just over a half-million dollars. In 1973, we achieved 17 percent growth. Twenty percent growth followed in 1974.

With virtually no track record as a company and products as yet unproven in the field, BG faced stiff competition in the recruitment of outstanding salespeople. Still, with an organization where quality of product and loyalty to distributors were the two principle tenets of doing business, there came in time some excellent new associates for our infant company.

The early years were full of lessons. There were trying times as we worked out bugs in just about every aspect of the business, right down to how the product was packaged and shipped.

By the 1980s, the fabricator of all BG formulas had been sold to a new company which quickly decided to close the Wichita plant. BG purchased the Wichita facility and was now making the products it was marketing. With a research laboratory of our own and proprietary manufacturing processes, the company was ready to develop new products and to fully capitalize on its existing products.

There have been exceptional milestones along the way which have established the quality of our products. In 1998, our 300,000 mile test of BG additives in a road-weary Mazda finally came to an end after four grueling years. Monitored by independent laboratories, the test determined that the vehicle maintained the fuel mileage, performance and emission standards of a new engine. Our technicians completely tore down the engine and determined that all the engine parts were still within new specifications.

As the maintenance requirements of ever more sophisticated engines have grown from model year to model year, BG has kept pace with detailed, comprehensive educational programs, a commitment to education resulting in the founding of our own BG University in 1999. Every group clinic, every on-wheel demonstration of BG products and services has two overriding goals: benefits for vehicle owners and profitability for the professionals who use our products, equipment and services.

As we approached a new millennium, BG took a number of bold steps to set the pace for change in the industry. Recognizing a need to help our distributors create demand for our products, we initiated a brand awareness program that placed BG before a nationwide audience of industry professionals. The program raised the profile of company in trade magazines and racing venues. BG also began to sponsor auto-advice programming on radio and television.

Today BG additive systems include not only the product, but the service tools to deliver that product as well as complete training support for service technicians. Today BG does not just sell a product, we market service brands that expand the profit-potential of dealer service departments, while ensuring automotive maintenance of superb reliability.

BG Products was born of necessity. We have prospered because of opportunity. Opportunities created. Opportunities seized.

We have grown because of a rare stability in our ownership. Where competitors, as with the vast majority of companies in the petrochemical industry, have undergone merger after merger, acquisition after acquisition, BG has forged ever ahead under the steady guidance of directors in a line of succession begun at our founding with seven entrepreneurial war heroes.

The expertise that we have developed throughout the last decades has had a profound impact in the world and particularly in developing countries. We developed the first vaccine against the dengue virus, which infects 390 million people each year and whose circulation has continued to increase as a result of climate change. The first vaccination campaigns against dengue began in 2016 in the Philippines. Thanks to systematic vaccination campaigns, we are also about to eradicate polio, while over the past 10 years, treatment against sleeping sickness have saved more than 180,000 lives. We also offer innovative treatments against often fatal diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Yet there is a long way to go for a third of the world population still lacks access to health. Health products and services we offer are only part of the solution to address the health inequalities that impede human development. As a responsible healthcare leader, we must adapt the conduct of our business in order to honor our health commitment in favor.

This responsibility is ours also means that we continue to develop innovative solutions and make them available to all who need them. For this, we strive to be responsive to our stakeholders and inscribe our actions as part of a collaborative approach. That's why we partnered with various organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the GAVI Alliance and the World Health Organization.

Finally, our health promoting commitment goes well beyond the drug and is available through our approach to social responsibility of the company and our determination to make a real difference in the daily lives of women and men who populate our planet.

We've been aiding the development of Myanmar people in Micro Business since 2012. Our Executive Director and Founder Ryan Russell founded a boutique business startup and micro finance program in Yangon that helped hundreds of Myanmar people understand how to start businesses. That journey continues with Micro Empire.
 
Through our previous experience with Micro Businesses we learned that people in Myanmar really need to understand their personal finances to be able to make good decisions for their families. We decided to develop personal finance training to help people get a handle on what they could do with what they have and also when they needed to borrow money and why. We also saw that people needed someone to stick with them closer for a longer period of time after they started their businesses. To have someone that would help them overcome hurdles at different stages of their businesses. So we decided to invest our money in fewer businesses with more impact. To really grow these businesses instead of watching them struggle.

Company Description:Today, Connell Brothers is still privately held by Wilbur-Ellis and continues to grow organically and through acquisitions. The company remains completely focused on being one of the premier distributors of specialty chemicals and ingredients in Asia-Pacific.
Date Founded: 1898
Status: Qualified Lead
Ownership: Public
Company Overview: A century of success in Asia-Pacific

Connell Brothers was founded by Morris J. and John Connell, domestic brokers in Seattle Washington who saw great potential in the opportunities that trade with Asia could offer. Though Atlantic-European trade patterns still dominated the international economic scene, in 1898 the brothers made the bold decision to open offices in Shanghai and Manila and began shipping flour from Seattle to the cities of Asia-Pacific.

The fledging trading company was an immediate success, and by the 1930s, no other American trading company was as well respected, had the depth of experience or understood the Asian market as well as Connell Brothers. The company’s prestigious reputation attracted the attention of Wilbur-Ellis Company, an import and commodity trading company well known in California and along the West Coast. In 1931, Connell Brothers became a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilbur-Ellis, and the company’s headquarters moved from Seattle to San Francisco.

After World War ll, as the Asia-Pacific region began to dismantle the colonial system, Asian markets needed everything from canned goods to light bulbs, from construction materials to heavy equipment. Connell Brothers adapted quickly to the changes in the region and was there to supply these and many other products, including industrial chemicals, plastics and plastic raw materials, pharmaceuticals, flavors and fragrances, textiles and synthetic fibers.

By the close of the 1970s, Asia-Pacific had gained the world’s attention as one of the most important trading areas with tremendous growth potential. Recognizing the value of Connell Brothers’ longstanding customer relationships, major U.S. manufacturers, many ranked in the Fortune 500, selected Connell Brothers as their marketing representative in the region. The dramatic growth in market share created by these partnerships firmly established Connell Brothers’ reputation as one of the most successful marketing and distributor companies in Asia-Pacific going into the 21st century. By the 1980s, Connell Brothers focused its business completely on specialty chemicals and ingredients.

Company Overview: Leopard Capital manages private equity funds in frontier economies. We enter pre-emerging economies as a pioneer investor and form on-site teams to access uncommon opportunities.  Our early-mover strategy reflects the contrarian investment ethos of our founder, Douglas Clayton and our chairman, Marc Faber.

During the depths of the 2008-9 financial crisis we raised Cambodia's first private equity fund. Leopard Cambodia Fund has since made 13 investments in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand and achieved six exits. In 2012 following Haiti's devastating earthquake we launched Haiti's first private equity fund, Leopard Haiti Fund, with backing from The World Bank's International Finance Corp (IFC), The Inter-American Development Bank's Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), and Netherlands Development Finance (FMO). Leopard Haiti Fund now holds three investments in drinking water, disaster-resilient construction, and pay television businesses.

Leopard Capital is domiciled in Cayman Islands and has presences in Thailand, Cambodia, and Haiti.

Company Description:AMT was founded 40 years in Myanmar, but founded as an official group in 2005.

HQ for AMT is in Mandalay, very conservative place. Off days only on Sabbath day (not Sat & Sundays) due to the culture out there. In Yangon, half day on Sat. Still setting IT, so very bad email address and no websites right now.

Director - Ko Min Thant, running the business and working hand in hand with KBZ for cement projects (Sin Minn & KBZ Cement, and JV with Larfarge Holcim) and Insurance (IKBZ) and meet with foreign investors

1 CEO and 1 CFO for Rose Hill Holding - Rose Hill Residence is built in JV with Soilbuild - 60% Soilbuild and 40% Rose Hill holding (owns the land). Management support comes from Singapore office. Spent 1 million USD in marketing, which wasn't effective at all due to lack of local content and knowledge.

Organization Structure

Chairman
MD
D
GM
DGM/AGM
Managers for each unit
Executives and assistants
Has over 300 office staffs right now, not including hard labor for planting Rubber, Eucalyptus trees and Teak.  

Decision making power is centralized by the MD and ever changing. So wants those 4 persons - 2 CEOs and 2 CFOs who can bring changes to the orgazination (family centric), can discuss & argue with MD- U Hla Myo, AMT Group.

If they become a holding, they can offer salary in USD, for now it's a bit of an extra work to pay in USD, but should not be a problem.
