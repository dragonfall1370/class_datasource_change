Date added: 2016-02-28 || Action: Outbound Call || Talked to her over the phone on 27/2/2016.
She has worked with FrieslandCampina as an external branding and marketing consultant. OK to work with 2 expats, but not with local marketing team as they don't understand the basic marketing concept and try to copy other brands' marketing style, which won't work and cut the tie with her like 3 months ago.
Can do short term contract (project), but cannot go into corporate full time as she is running her own business and has  clients. 

Now in a rural area (I forgot the name), will be back in Yangon on 1 of March and has other projects waiting for her.

She felt the interview went very well and they are looking to setting up a new pillar and her lead that team in the commercial side of things the title would still be account director.

Discussed almost an hour on CCS. He strongly feels that Rinat wants someone from Microfinance background. Did some homework prior meeting them, but the strategy used in Microfinace what Rinat mentioned was totally different from what he's familiar with.

With vast market research in rural areas and an extensive contacts list within the telecom industry and retail shops, we believe he would be an excellent fit for Viber. His approach to business is a well thought out structure with an understanding of the culture and how to approach business within the Myanmar market with hard work and dedication. His current salary is $4000 USD per month with an incentive of $500 USD if targets are reached and a housing allowance of $1500 USD and a company driver and general insurance.

Date added: 2016-08-16 || Action: Outbound Call || Called to check on her and check if Eliott is in Yangon to have a follow up with my roles.

Sara just finished her probation and was given a notice from HR that she has passed and now doing operational activities. She is enjoying it and would like to meet for a chat next week with her bf.

She is asking help in finding a good job for her sister. She is very junior though so it is not easy.
Date added: 2016-06-24 || Action: Other || I met with Sara for the celebration of her placement at Marga and also to know her status at the company.
She said at this point, she is still ok. There are times that it is boring because there are not many things to do. She only have some if Eliott or Moses ask her to help with something, which includes going to a meeting with government officials and helping out with James of the marketing department. I feel like she is not getting the excitement she used to have when working at HAGL; however, she is remaining positive. She is using the time to do studying for her MBA and also relishing some technical skills Eliott is teaching her.
She said that Eliott is nice but straightforward, which does not bother her much but sometimes surprises her. Like in one instance, Eliott was telling her somthing and as a newbie and trying to prove herself, she just agrees to do even if she does not have any idea. Then Eliott told her, ""Sara if you don't know something, just tell me and I will teach you. Do not pretend that you know."" :) 

She also feels like they are making her the face of the company that is why they are making her work with James sometimes and taking her to meetings. Well, it could be true. Sara is pretty!
On another note, as Sara also explains, the government put on hold all high-rise buildings so Marga's projects are affected. They are supposed to start another high-rise building project very soon. Now they can only start with 2 2-storey buildings in few months. This is the reason why there are not much work for Sara and probably the reason why they are not still hiring for some of the roles i am doing.

Sara works with 3 other people in the team, Moses and 2 other international EDs. She is the only lady, but she goes out with the other ladies at the marketing team(most of them there are ladies). She also told me the Head of HR has given birth yesterday, but 2 of her executives are doing the works for her.

She's asking of Eliott's feedback on her. At this point, I don't have yet!
Date added: 2016-03-31 || Action: Outbound Call || Moses called saying they agree with Sara's conditions:
salary= 1,700,000 MMK net
Saturdays= they need her to be present on very busy days
will make LOA and contract right away.
They asked that she will perform according to their expectations in return.

Met with Sara for coffee and she needs to see the contract and will resign soon as she receives the LOA. All is good!
Date added: 2016-03-30 || Action: Outbound Call || talked to Eliott and Moses of Marga. They would like to offer Sara 1,500,000 MMK as salary and the title Business Development Manager as opposed to Assistant Business Development Manager they first spoke to her about.

talked to Sara: She is excited about the offer but has to think about it because the salary is much lower than what her expected salary is. Also they are not offering any transportation whereas in her company now they give her car and driver plus she enjoys her own office space.
waiting for her callback with decision before getting back to Moses.
Date added: 2016-03-24 || Action: Outbound Call || She is concerned about the title of the role which is Assistant Business Development Manager.. said she is in a manager position now and will be going to a lower level if she accepts that.. also, as the title shows on her name card, she would be given less priority at government offices if they see her title.

Eliott however says, if all Sara cares about is the title, she is not fit to work at Marga.
Date added: 2016-03-21 || Action: Outbound Call || After CCM: sounds happy.. said the interview went very well. Eliott met her for 10 minutes on a longyi.. he introduced her to Antony who explained what their businesses are in detail.. it lasted an hour and 30 minutes.. and he will discuss with Eliott and see if they can arranged another interview with the other executive directors.

would like to know the feedback.
Date added: 2016-03-17 || Action: Prescreen || Excellent English. fun and active. Pretty. ambitious. confident
knows a lot about real estate. can deal well with government staff and engineers.
taking up MBA now.. would like to have her own business in the future.

CS: $1,200 net
B: phone allowance - $50/mo
     car + driver, own office space, life insurance
ES: $1800 net, car (weekdays), office space
NP: 1 month

Date added: 2016-03-16 || Action: Outbound Call || Was contacted for Dagon Group a year ago..  was wondering what happened to it.
She is still interested with new roles and is willing to meet."

REASON FOR LEAVING: Come Myanmar to look for adventure.

NOTES: Very arrogant. When introduced about TPG/IBTC, he said that post is more fit for expat with less experience and train in-house. He thinks he is senior for that post (which is not correct). His Burmese writing and reading is terrible. Right now, he wants to stay at CDSG for 2 years; he doesn't want to leave without projects are finished - he doesnt feel fair if he leaves.

Date added: 2015-06-12 || Action: Email || Ramani feedback on MNA head of marketing interview- The interview went well,i hope:) she had asked some of the questions you did have in mind, so that was great.
She was honest about some of the aspects of marketing and how it was still very new of a concept to the locals but thats completely understandable for emerging markets. I would have to bear with the frustrations that may come with it.
Otherwise, it was ok and hopefully i do get a shot at a 2nd interview.
Thanks again for this opportunity. If anything, it was for the experience:)

Date added: 2015-06-02 || Action: Prescreen || PRESENTATION AND COMMUNICATION:
Looks a bit weird, bad eye contact, not overly smart and a bit creepy. I asked for an overview and he said well you saw my cv!! got power back in interview but didnt come across well, was thinking for a recruitment role but definitley not, too weird.

AMBITIONS FOR NEXT ROLE:
loves relationship managament and enjoys sales but wants to get out of ads, looking into NGO's, PR agencies and also gov relations. interviewing with a pr firm and some other roles. has experience teaching business english and would maybe consider him for the copywriter role with synapse but only if desperate, too arrogant. 

MOTIVATIONS:
wants to feel special, stay in something long term without so much pressure. wants to live and work in developing countries as he struggled a lot in DC and prefers getting out - typical run away cause not succeeding at home expat. fluent in parsi though and spent a year in iran (i think). 

REASON FOR LEAVING:
dvb - fired, last day is the 22nd june 2015, he didnt meet his sales targets, he said it was mutual but came out that really it wasnt. Originally he said he wanted to leave because the company was making a transition from NGO to private but wasnt doing it very well at all. 

NOTES:
He reports to Chris who is the only other expat in the sales team at DVB who is the sales director. Also mentioned Sonia who used to work in the sales team. Will headhunt chris as he sounds like he is very good. 
Overall a very bad candidate, didnt get a good feeling and feel like he would come across very badly in interview. He is also willing to take a cut in salary which is odd and came across arrogant and like he was better than us at the start of the interview. Geeky looking but sweet enough guy but not sure if we can help. 
Friends with Felix Haas and also Michael Guarino. 

CURRENT: 2000 plus all expenses including visa runs etc. 
EXPECTED: 1500 - 2500 (benefits depend on base) flexible. 
NOTICE: current role finishes on june 22nd 2015.

Manuela is adaptable, flexible and has the ability to handle multiple projects at the same time with 10 years of legal and compliance experience.  She is an Italian national with excellent English and is very strong in drafting contracts across a variety of industries. She has just moved to Myanmar from Milan and her partner has signed a minimum 2 year contract in the country. Manuela has a degree in law but doesn’t have additional diploma to be fully licensed but well versed in contracts, transactions and negotiations of contracts as well as advising on compliance. Another strength of Manuela’s is her internal training skills and ability to liaise with multiple internal and external departments which she has done over the past 10 years. Her weakness is a lack of exposure to more detailed financing law and structuring and not being trained in common law. She interviewed fantastically and has a passion to get stuck in and help where she can – we think she would be a great culture fit with Anthem too.  Her salary in Milan was 2500 Euros net per month + benefits, her expected salary is $3000 USD per month and she is available immediately.

Not interested in analyst position. 
Want to take leadership and management role, and build relationship. Prefer Finance Industry - PE firm/ trade finance/ corporate finance. Geopolitics matters her (a bit risk adverse).

Date added: 2015-07-21 || Action: Appointment || Rebecca - I met with Tracey for Lunch at Parami Pizza on the 21st July 2015 at 12pm. She seemed happy that the office is closer to her house. She mentioned that the office didn't have many people in on her floor but she was adjusting to this. She mentioned that Nay OO mentioned Peter had a PA just before her that only lasted two weeks as she was too stressed out with the work load. She mentioned that Peter is making her do general secretarial work that she is able to do at ease and then a lot of economic and political research especially about the elections coming up. Which she said she is finding interesting but slightly challenged as she has never been pushed before to do research in areas she is not familiar with. overall I think she is enjoying the work but is being slightly challenged and is adapting to a different working environment which will be  good for her. She also did mention that Pizza Hut staff/ office will be moving into the same level as her.
Date added: 2015-07-13 || Action: Outbound Call || tracey first day going well except for the fact that she thought the team would be bigger and people are working quite independently which she isnt used to - really cannot get her head around the IT system and so just trying to learn that today. told her to go and find Laura (HR manager) who we placed a while back and she will help. Peter has a meeting at 6pm so i guess he is going to the british chamber too. 
Date added: 2015-07-03 || Action: Offer Extended || 
Trial Offer

1250 USD start date 10th July 2015

Date added: 2015-06-25 || Action: Outbound Call || Peter asked Tracey to go for a meeting with Nay oo and send her cv to him to look over. He suggested Monday 9 am at the offices, waiting to receive her confirmation if this meeting goes well they are hoping to look out and sort an offer.
Date added: 2015-06-22 || Action: Email || Peters Feedback on Tracey - I interviewed Tracey this morning, I was impressed with her competence base, she had an engaging personality and I am sure she would be an effective EPA.
My concern is only what I raised last night in that I see her as an alternative to Tina not an interim solution which would not be fair on either party in my view.
In this scenario, the better long term candidate for Jardines would, in my view, be Tina which is not to denigrate Tracey in any shape or form.
I will look to see if there are any other solutions which would involve engaging both ladies but I think the chances are remote.
At this juncture I prefer the Interim/Tina route if it is still available but let me ponder a while longer and make enquiries.
Date added: 2015-06-21 || Action: Outbound Call || Tracey feedback on the interview - She thought it went very well he asked her about her roles and responsibilities and he explained to her about the company ad what they do here and what he is looking for from her. He asked her to send him directly to his email her cv without our edits on it.
Date added: 2015-06-19 || Action: Other || She received a 550 USD bonuses for the last three months as she had an increase of responsibility as the visa section was closing down and transferred.

There is a lot to do and there's many questions. But I think there needs to be a strategic map, probably a few maps, on how exactly is MNA going to achieve them. 

 I need to be able to quantify the job. I know this is confidential but a ballpark revenue number is good to understand. That is important because it defines the job and is most definitely the primary key result area for such a position. 

It's just like you're asking me to build you a house, but what kind of a house, down to the granular details, and that'll change the value of the house and also how much it's going to cost to build it.

This is my current remuneration package :
 1. Base salary MYR16,000, annual tickets, rebate travel, ZED fares, annual leave 28 days.
2. Posting : GBP2400
3. Benefits for posting : car, accommodation, house utilities and maintenance expenses, child education up to 4 kids, medical, dental, home travel.

As spoken, I'm simply providing to you my after tax salary and the key benefits. I would imagine a package will be offered and will need to be negotiated.

Base after tax salary : Minimum USD16,000 per month. I don't have enough details about the job, it will change depending on key result areas required of the job.
Key benefits :  car, accommodation, house utilities and maintenance expenses, child education.

I've left medical and dental out as unlike the UK which has a national scheme, I'm not certain what's the medical availability and quality is like in Myanmar. Most likely its private hospitals and dental practices where insurance will be required. I've left other details also as I would prefer MNA to offer. 

If I'm successful, I need to provide 3 months notice to my current employer. I can try to negotiate a shorter period."

2- Still applying MIC and no office staff (no one to talk to), rather than Andy himself working from the hotel and BD Associate. 

Baker has lots of staff and she gets to communicate with them and travel. Told Andy she needs some time to think over. Likes Andy, but not sure the environment will be convenient for her. 
Will get back with an answer next week Wednesday.

Date added: 2016-06-09 || Action: Email || Dear Ma Bo Mee,

Thank you for interest on me as well as contacted me 

By taking this opportunity, let me introduce about my current job title and background.


As a Senior Associate in Advisory, PwC Myanmar, I have involved in internal audit, due diligence and other advisory projects across several sectors such as retail, agriculture, real estate development, mechanical and engineering, health care, oil and gas and telecom industries. 

While working for three years in PwC, I dealt with not only local conglomerates but also international corporations from Japan, Korea and China.

I have assisted local clients in implementing accounting frameworks and financial management reporting systems. Since I have been helping in various market entry and market research projects, I have extensive and relevant local industry knowledge in Myanmar.

For my qualification background, I hold a bachelor’s degree specialized in Japanese from Yangon University of Foreign Languages and also obtained MBA from Yangon Institute of Economics.
 


Please feel free to contact me if you have other job opportunities that I could pursue a new challenge outside the Firm.
Let's keep in touch in future.

Best regards,
Hanny"

Date added: 2016-06-21 || Action: Inbound Call || Asked me to negotiate with Alex about the salary. He mentioned his expected salary is $2,000 during the interview and Alex is saying they are paying in MMK. He said he failed to mention he is being paid in dollars and the exchange rates.
Advised him to wait for the offer first before negotiating because there might be other things in the offer that needs discussion before agreeing.
Date added: 2016-06-20 || Action: Outbound Call || After CCM: Phyo met with Alex and Derrick and they have a very good conversation. He has a better perception on Marga and the role after this meeting. The Marga guys, I believe, were able to address the concerns Phyo brought up that I have discussed with Eliott. 
According to Alex and Derrick, the role is still the same -- Sr. Business Development Manager. He would be more focused on Sr. Management meetings with government officials.  For now, the responsibilities will still be broad, but they will put him on public relations later on. They will have to train him on translations, and perhaps, other skills for now.
Date added: 2016-06-15 || Action: Outbound Call || After CCM:
met with antony, moses and 2 others(someone with glasses?); eliott was not around.

The job scope involves a lot of live translations which for him is a lot of challenge that is why he might not want to take the job, but want to know what they will offer. They tested his Burmese!

said they will think and might offer him other roles in the company.

He is not very excited about Marga.. said he is working for an MNC and does not do translations so he might pass this opportunity. He is asking for other opportunities.

For me, he is a good candidate in his field.. it's a shame he does bite to the rewards he might get form the company.

Cronan spoke to Major Naing and with her in particular the salary is an issue. The highest paid employee currently gets $4000 per month. I am not sure if Mya Seine Yee is at all flexible on salary but we know they won't pay $5,000. Please let us know your thoughts on this.""

Date added: 2016-02-01 || Action: Outbound Call || The worst candidate I've ever met. Money is all that matters to him. Wants 6000 Net + Housing or 7000 USD Net, which is quadruple to his current earning - 2000 USD gross. Said he'll leave the firm right away if he gets an offer from a foreign bank. Think he is the best in financing law in Myanmar. No explanation for being greedy and was angry at himself for not making the same money as his friends from Baker &amp; McKenzie and Luther Law Firm. I think it's his attitude and arrogant holding him back, which in terms show him as an incompetent candidate to take on big roles. 
He said he's discussing with his current company to give him a raise - 3500 USD net, but he himself doesn't think it's happening.

Notes

I don’t like his attitude. Too arrogant I’d say. 
Applied head of legal at SMBC. Passed phone interview and face to face interview, but didn’t get the offer. He demanded 7000 USD Net…. He still thinks it’s because of his English. 

Very competent in his field ….. rather a generalist. Handles offshore financing and property development/ Realestate for Singapore firms such as Keppel lands, Polo Club, SG JV with Shwe Taung for New Bo Gyoke Market and many more. Have been in legal for almost a decade. 
Headhunted by US firm first and the Sg firm. Have only 3 people in the office now. Direct report to Rep … Sg office helps with the legal drafting respectively and his assistant. Knows the local authority in the legal quite well and very good PR. Never miss any seminar. MONEY Motivated. Wants to visit his brother in the U.S. Single and lives in Insein. 

Current Salary: $2000 USD Gross
Expected Salary: $7000 USD Net  (his current firms promised they’ll triple his salary by end of this year and give him partnership in 4 years time.)

Soon to become the head of legal at Telenor, she is well respected by her previous employers for her ability to support a legal team as well as focus on strategic and governance aspects to her role. All of her moves have been due to her thirst for legal knowledge and more exposure. She has experience in private practice and in-house with both international and local firms and has worked across various sectors, including FMCG, trading, private equity and telecommunications.

Date added: 2015-09-07 || Action: Prescreen || Talked to Khun Wa Thainn on 6/9/2015 regarding Purchasing officer for Apollo Towers. He is interested. Currently, he is earning 1,200 USD at IGE (still at probation period). There is a local start up Oil &amp; Gas company offering him GM position and salary 2,300 USD. But he is allowed to join 2 months later which he thinks is a long time. So basically he is open for new position. Salary he would accept is minimum  - 2,000 USD. More interested in BD though he is from procurement background.

A very nice guy - ambitious and knowledge in Oil &amp; Gas sector in Myanmar(met him as I thought he was a lady because of the name)! Loves meeting new people and fast paste working environment.

Has his own avocado and coffee farm in Thaunggyi, partner with a European guy he met in a bar. The very thing he likes about working for IGE (current company) is the people he works with- retired seniors from military who have lots of knowledge in the field and who accept fresh ideas to drive business forward.

Enthusiastic

Ambitions and next job move

To have more exposure and work in a dynamic environment 


Reason for leaving
Shwe Inn Thar: General Khin Nyunt taken down by Than Shwe so projects had to stopped

Kyaw Htet Kyaw: located him in Nay Pyi Daw although they told him he'll be based in Yangon as the MD wants to be with him

Myanmar Dawoo: GM - Burmese lady, not being professional. Bureaucratic. Very biased and flirtatious 

IGE: Personal attack by U Nay Aung (Chairman) because of jealousy

Myanmar Awba (Current company, still working there) : boss is not expanding any business as he is depressed with his family- has only one daughter who is not interested in taking on his business, and he wants Myint Ko to be his son, which annoys him sometimes because he has his own family

Motivators

Challenges, autonomy,

Notes
(Got headhunted by Sudha and met with her and a management person last month. But he didn't join as Sudha told him he would be assistant manager and after probation period he would be promoted to Manager level which he doubted because his assistant was told the same thing and she got never promoted. He wants the position be clear and see his potential)

Very impressive candidate who can communicate every ministry and result driven although quite young. Super open and optimistic about life. He has a family in Yangon. Loves travelling and client facing a lot.

AMBITIONS FOR NEXT ROLE: Marketing Manager (he doesn't want Director level because he loves getting in touch with the market, talking consumers and more active in the market.)

MOTIVATIONS: Won't go to Tabacco or beverage industry anymore as his parents insist strongly. The eldest son and taking care of his parents.

REASON FOR LEAVING: Left Ma Ma Noodle - Started as entry level way up to Assistant Manager (Sales &amp; Mkt). There were 3 shareholders there and had internal problem which lead one shareholders to left. After that problem, he left too.

Left Myanmar Beer - Joined as Management Trainee and became a Brand Executive after that training. One of the company director moved to Mandalay Rum (Victory) and the boss drew him out of Tiger to Mandalay Rum.

Left Mandalay Rum - Called back by Myanmar Beer

Left Myanmar Beer again - His parents insists to work for Beverage Industry
 
NOTES: A very good market planner for Beverage but sadly it is not his consideration anymore. 

- Lucky Draw under lid - which made 60% increment in Sales Revenue for Myanmar Beer
- On- premise outlet exclusively for Mandalay Rum
- 100 outlets in Upper Myanmar - Mandalay Rum got higher consumption in Upper Myanmar than Lower.

VG background in marketing at 2 alcohol companies - Myanmar Brewery and Mandalay Rum.
Resigned to give peace to her parents who are against him working for alcohol companies. He has taken the jobs in the first place because of the experience and packages that comes with it.
When he resigned, APB offered him a position with higher package but he refused.

He is currently taking classes at Strategy First and is looking for new opportunities. He is into sales and marketing but prefers marketing more and would like a more active role that involves him dealing with people - customers. He doesn't mind what industry it is because he is confident his skills are transferable/ adaptable but more inclined to telecoms or FMCG (except alcohol).

Date added: 2015-10-29 || Action: Email || Dear Caroline; 

Thanks for your email and interested on me as well. 

However, I would like you to know that I'm NOT interested to work in Procurement Job any more since this is routine job. 
My purpose of joining to Daewoo is to get experience form International Organization as well as to know the nature of Oil &amp; Gas Operator Company. 
Daewoo is well - organized organization and formatted with their system. It is not interesting and i thought that my capacity is being drop off. 

FYI, I was working as Project Development Manager, at that time, needed to liaise with Ministry (MOE, etc) and with International Company also. So I got a lot of experience, creative thinking, Problem solving skill and networking skill as well. 

Thus, if there is a chance for such kind of career in international company, I like to try. 

And if you have opportunities which meet with my desire above, please let me know. 

Thanks again for your opportunities.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Very soft voice (had to concentrate 100%)
Under dress, brought her boyfriend for the interview


Ambitions and next job move

For better pay and future

Reason for leaving

Naw Trading - no progress even in 2 years, so left it
San Lwin - start up, no progress (Dr.Win Aung from Alvogen called her to join the team)
Alvogen (currently company, still working there) - from her perspective, no future and better pay. Only workload increased over time.


Motivators

Money, Career Advancement, Stability


Notes

Very nice lady. But a bit junior for the Regulatory Services Manager. She was trained by Dr. Win Aung from Mega. Not happy at Alvogen due to company poor performance in importing medicine - registration for each product taking up to 2.5 years till distribution and some medicine becomes expired and making too much loss. She is taking both manager and executive positions, reporting to local country manager. But doesn't feel like she is appreciated. 

Current Salary: $ 400+ yearly bonus (December - but has never got it yet as the company is making loss)
Expected Salary: $ 1,500
Notice Period: 2 Months"

YOMA Realestate - 2500 USD Net (accepted only this one)
Date added: 2015-12-22 || Action: Outbound Call || Talked to Miki after receiving feedback from Jerome. A good personality fit, but no PR background and very limited translation skills in Burmese. Will have second thought if she'd be happy to take Account Manager position with the salary - 1,000,000 MMK. Didn't tell her that instead told her she is not ready for Account Director position yet, and a bit senior than Account Manager as I know if I told her Jerome words, she'd be upset and lose impression on Aquila too. 

Alpha Search contacted her for YOMA - Marketing Manager position. Still meeting them. Will reach me once she's made up her mind. Rejected KBZ already as she doesn't like Zin Mar Adkin.
Date added: 2015-08-12 || Action: Prescreen || Very sociable and result-oriented person at heart.  Born in Myanmar and raised in Singapore. Currently working as a Country Manager for Sedgwick Richardson (SEA) on retained basis (1,500 USD per month) as ground testing in Myanmar. Speaks fluent English and Burmese and fair Mandarin. Good at bringing in clients and building strong relationship. Has particular interest in client facing and negotiation. Her last drawn salary in Singapore was 6,000 SGD gross per month + commission. Her expected salary is negotiable and her notice period is 1 month. 

Will live in Myanmar for a very long time as her husband has his own business set up here. Her extended family - mon, dad &amp; siblings live in Singapore. Currently, their son is only 4 months old. She can leave him at home with the nurse as the son doesn't like drinking mom's milk. She used to commit her life - 24/7 for work in Singapore which she now think affect her family life. So she can't do that anymore. "

Very friendly and confident in his knowledge

Ambitions and next job move

2. Tower Company 
3. NGOs &amp; Embassy (Procurement Section Only)
Apollo already approached him. Has offer from Australia now. But he wants to stay here till end of March 2016 as his kids are studying here. If he hasn't secured a job by then, he'll relocate his whole family to India.

Interviewed him with Caroline

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Montone (a bit boring)
Very calm and dress professional attire


Ambitions and next job move

Take an opportunity with better pay  (in fact double his current salary)

Reason for leaving

PTTEP  - contract based
Petronas -  contract over and got offer from U.S embassy


Motivators

MONEY and Money alone though he said future improvement (I personally couldn't feel it). He keeps saying Money too often. His whole family is in New York. 


Notes

I won't put him forward for any position although he is good at procurement. It's very likely if he gets a better offer, he'll just change from job to job. He doesn't seem to care any improvement at all. Having proper policy within the organisation is crucial for him. If he gets green-card, he'd go there and stay for 3 - 6 months and come back to Myanmar and live here with his wife (not married now yet). 

Current Salary  : 2000 USD gross + medical benefits + 1 month bonus
Expected Salary: 4000 USD gross
Notice Period: 1 month
Date added: 2015-09-09 || Action: Prescreen || Maung Maung Aung interviewed on Wednesday September 9th at 5pm in our office. 
Maung Maung Aung, nice with a good presentation, is currently purchasing agent at the American Embassy Rangoon with a team comprised of 5 persons.  
Although he possesses good communication skills with a good english and listening, during the interview he lacked liveliness and dynamism. He has a 2 years of experience in procurement and like his job and is interested about working for an international company. He showed a big importance about the money. His current salary is 2000+USD gross and his expected is 4000 USD. His notice period is 1 month. 
In my opinion, he is not right for the position as purchasing officer with Apollo.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Very calm (monotone) 
Knowledgeable in Power sector and verbal


Ambitions and next job move

Join MD level in Power Sector (comparing herself to her friends who are at higher rank in Hotel industry)


Reason for leaving

Ruby Dragon (worked there for 11 years) let it as the last project, Hotel had to be cancelled due to political instability and the company didn't perform well after General Khin Nyunt  (was working hand in hand with their company) was taken down from power by Than Shwe

Motivators

Autonomy, Title and exposure

Notes

I'd definitely put her forward in Power Sector (EPC and Back Up Power) for management position. Doesn't want to join Parami because it's their counterpart. Ethical down to earth and simple. She's underpaid at the current company, but she doesn't know about it. Impressively knowledgeable and knows what she does and all the ministries (8) related to power sector like MEPE, MOGE and MIA. Being single, doesn't mind travelling and networking. She's been headhunted twice (Mitsubishi - still accepts her and the other one, which she regrets for not preparing her CV well).

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Great, Very professional and proactive, Smart attire, 
Polite and Assertive


Ambitions and next job move

To be more on the commercial side


Reason for leaving

Notes

Super experienced in Pharmaceutical side. Always exceeds the target and lead the team and assertive. His love on consumers (patients) far more important than the profit margins. Fair and square.

Didn't asked him his current salary and expected salary as he got very upset when he heard our client was Zuellig. He thought our client with be a big pharmaceutical company (distributor) from Switzerland. He said Zuellig's unreliable brand. It planed to come in Myanmar in late 1990s and didn't actually come. Very small company in compare to Novartis. Loves travelling.
Regulatory affairs is not his expertise, he is more on BD, market expansion and building team and training them. Said RA is paper work - always changing FDA, DFDDA in Myanmar. Said there is only 2 very good RAM in Myanmar from Mega and Roche, and one lady who he doesn't know for who she works for.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills
Very friendly, Bubbly, Patient
Not assertive
Prefers working with team and well structured company

Ambitions and next job move
Better pay and autonomy


Reason for leaving

Feel her current company's activities conflict her ethical standing point; carrying out illegal trading and money laundering (work with government official on Timber business too)
Lack of respect amongst peers and very limited autonomy

YoungBen Electronic Bike- broke engagement with her fiance and share taken out


Motivators
Money, autonomy, respect and career advancement


Notes
I won't put her forward for any role for now. Academically  very intelligent ... has been to Singapore and London on exchange program while she was studying in India. She has potential, but lack of enthusiasm due to family matters and work related - personal attack pressure. Needs a little motivation and vision. For the long run, having studied medicine, she wants to open a pharmaceutical store in Yangon.

Date added: 2016-05-30 || Action: Outbound Call || Yasemin has decided to hire A Ukrainian lawyer for the role instead, she found her herself and although she has no common law or senior level experience, the company has budget restrictions and so pulled the verbal offer away from Bryan a second time. Apollo are becoming a more difficult client with larger budget restrictions these days, the legal team is now severely under qualified and this hire has created some frustrations within other departments. I emailed HR t explain my thoughts but they will not budge on this. Bryan is quite upset but I will continue to put him forward for the senior lawyer position with LWA.

To be in a forward thinking company in SEA 


Reason for leaving

QuisLex (Current company) - not forward thinking and no fault admitting pulling off development, dense population.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Very outgoing, fun and open
Great, fashionable 
Very good English &amp; Burmese


Ambitions and next job move

Join a company based in Myanmar where she has more exposure and career advancement for the long run


Reason for leaving

Windwood Furniture (owned by TayZa) - political instability
My Jobs - too narrow scope of working (boring package for clients and candidates)
RMA (current company) - still working here, wants to leave due to office politics - MD is a local, GM is an expat. May is in charge doing marketing for Jaguar, Land Rover and Ford). MD expects her to report her directly as she is a local. But GM, Mike Pease, prefers to go though him and sometimes he get upsets.

Motivators

Stability, Autonomy, 
Career advancement, Clear reporting line

Notes

Thanks for the update. I would be happy to be considered for the role with Lucy Wayne &amp; Associates. Could you give me more details about the position?Also, is it a family posting?I have attached an updated version of my resume. 

Best regards, 
Krishna Gagn

Hi Krishna,

I hope all is well with you.

It seems that Apollo are taking a long time to make a decision, I have been following up with them but it seems they need some more time - as soon as we hear something I will definitely keep you updated.

In the meantime, another client of mine: Lucy Wayne and Associates, (http://www.lwalegal.com/) who has been working in Myanmar since 20 years ago, is looking to hire a senior lawyer for her team. The website doesn't give much away but they are one of the most highly respected private practices here. Her Myanmar business partner U Win Naing is by far the most respected lawyer in the country and they are working extensively in some of the largest projects in the country, predominantly with large MNC's entering Myanmar.

Would you consider a law firm? Let me know if you would be interested?

All the best

Chloe

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Enthusiastic and confident in his expertise
Speak excellent Burmese (fair English – military doesn’t teach English language, learn it himself)
Very positive, calm and helpful (made phone call to his former staff to look for suitable candidates from President protection office team  --- he helped find two of his former colleagues a suitable position in corporate world)


Ambitions and next job move



Reason for leaving



Motivators

Stability
Working in Yangon to stay together with his wife and son (tired of travelling in his solider hood)
Commute convenience (long term viewer)
Autonomy and Trust



Notes

Got headhunted two times – Telenor &amp; Novotel, Chatrium always welcomes him.

I quite like him. Would absolutely recommend for Security positions, that don’t require traveling and long commute from his home.

He worked for President office after his service at Military. Joined Chatrium with the help of his wife (working at Inya Lake and her father works there too), she literally applied job for him. Left Chatrium and joined Telenor for a month (left it because Telenor asked him to travel to 325 cities as in charge of security, which wasn’t mentioned at the time they headhunted him (was told he’d be in charge of security for Telenor towering and be located in Yangon HQ), and Language barrier. Telenor did offer him 2 assistants for translation and other matters and 2600 USD as basic salary. But he left it anyway as he strongly believes he can’t contribute 100 % of his effort, and rejoined Chatrium (basic pay 1000 USD) again managing 35 security personals. Telenor found him when they relocated their team from Sule Shangri-La (Bomb explosion) to Chatrium. Novotel HR approached him too which he refuses the offer again. But he provided suggestions on how to arrange delegation, VIP trips and how to apply for security from the Government to management team in Novotel (offer him min 1500 USD, ready to offer more if he insists). He said no due to long commute and traffic as he lives in Bahan. 
Money doesn’t motivate him at all. 

Current salary: 1000 + 500 office check + 300 service money + annual bonus + gym + Laundry (one suit a day) + incentive

Expected salary: Negotiable (better pay and benefits of course)

It was only a quick call he was only considering staying in London or Singapore not Hong Kong and wasn't so keen on Myanmar as he had heard it was a little early for PE. He also has already spoken to a guy from Myanmar Investments as Angus (his father) is a corner stone investor in their company. They even said it was too early to be listing. The conclusion was he was going to take the interviews he had lined up in  London and for Singapore and maybe think about going to Myanmar in a few years time. He also lived with Fred Fishlock at university and it was more him try to persuade him to go."

Experience in procurement (5 years) currently in Ball Asia Pacific. She is fine in her current company but too far from her home and so too much time in the traffic.

Date added: 2015-10-16 || Action: Outbound Call || Talked with Nyo about the salary. Apollo thinks she is too expensive (CS is 3300 and 3500 USD after probation period) 
She told me that she is flexible but she is not interested under 3000 USD and she should not meet them if they offer her below 3000 USD.


Date added: 2015-10-11 || Action: Prescreen || Nyo Seint Aung is a very friendly and nice person. She speaks very fast and a lot with a strong accent. 

She is interested by doing accounting, tax, cash. She loves mathematics. 

Currently she works for international SOS, she is there for one month only. She likes but it's too general for her and not enough what she likes (accounting, tax). Her current working hours are 8 --&gt; 530.

She is ok for working for international and local. And the area that could interested her is Oil &amp; Gas.

The reason she left Digicel it's because they sold out. So she was embarrassed when we talked about Apollo. She thinks they are competitors. She was really interested by the role (treasury and tax manager) but she wasn't sure and asked to think about it when she knew the name of our client. 

Her current salary is 3000 USD gross (period of probation) and will be 3500 USD after her probation period + insurance and trainings.
Her expect salary is negotiable. 
Her notice period is 2 months. 

She seems really good for the position proposed but she was reluctant about the company.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Great personality
Professional attire and answer
Super polite
Speak perfect Burmese and English too



Ambitions and next job move

To pursue her passion in Tax, Account, Cash and Audit


Reason for leaving

Digicel - company phased out and also a lot of supplier chasing after payment and the cash shortage in the company

TN (Singapore) - parents asked her to come back as they relocated to Myanmar from U.S

KJ - wanted more challenges and experience in account and tax 


Motivators

Company's vision and long term commitment
Playing with numbers
Working with SMART and ambitious people
Heading Taxation, Cash Management, Audit and Accounting


Notes

I quite like her both personally and professionally. Have treasury and tax experience and already did her CPA in Myanmar and Singapore and finished ACCA. Very ambitious and forward thinker. Humble and flexible. Doesn't mind working with team or individually. Won't tolerate laziness and being stuck in a position. 
Have interest in Oil and Gas industry.



Current Salary: 3,300 USD net (during probation period Sep - Nov), will get 3,500 USD net after that

Expected Salary: Negotiable (willing to take a pay cut if the job itself and company is interesting)

Notice Period: 2 weeks before Dec, After Dec it'll be 2 months
Date added: 2015-10-07 || Action: Outbound Call || called Nyo Seint Aung, works currently for a small company but she told me that obviously she's interested for working for a bigger company and was open for talking further about a new job opportunity.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Great
Smart Presentation
Very Singaporean English



Ambitions and next job move



Reason for leaving

Harris Caprock : family matters (dad got stroke) 
Diethelm           : very routine and no challenges
Goh Kwang      : construction industry was going down in Sg
Keith Lim:         to gain more exposure and challenges



Motivators

close knitted company culture, travelling, autonomy, stability,
working with expats

Notes

A very good candidate. Has no interest in Construction industry (cash shortage and complexity). Prior consideration is Oil &amp; Gas, and Telecommunication Industry. Have intensive experience in Audit in Singapore and accounting in Myanmar too (including tax and treasury). 


Current Salary: 4,000USD $ gross + 4 months bonus in April + 1,000 $ health allowance for medical check up + performance bonus based on global cash flow (not net profit) + 20% yearly increment 
Expected Salary : Negotiable (she knows she's underpaid in Nokia but stick to it as she like the culture and the people she works with)

Date added: 2015-10-08 || Action: Prescreen || Khin Wah Wah Tin is 46. She seems young and she has a very good presentation. She is smart, talkative with a good english, dynamic, quick thinker and polite. 

She is ambitious and like challenges. She wants to progress in higher positions in her career path. She is very sociable and has a lot of friends (as she told). 
She is not afraid to work a lot and know working under a lot of pressure. 

The main reasons she leaves her previous jobs were because she wanted a better position and she came back to Myanmar because her father got a stroke so she wanted to be closer and be able to take care of him. 

She is highly motivated by challenges, she loves traveling, very sociable with strong communications skills. She is looking for stability. 

She is currently paid 4000 USD gross per month + benefits. She is flexible for her expected salary in a next job move. 

In my opinion she could be an excellente candidate for Apollo (neither for treasury and tax manager nor fixed assets accountant --&gt; too high level) but it is delicate for her to move in a new telecommunication company because she is already in a big telecommunication company and has a good relationship with her current company (Nokia Networks). 

The main reasons that could give her the motivation to move in an other job would be challenges, higher position or possibility to have it, working in a big international company. 
Date added: 2015-10-08 || Action: Outbound Call || called Khin Wah Wah Tin, at the first her office gave me a wrong number so I called them again and I could talk to Khin Wah Wah Tin directly. I got her mobile number. She seems interested about a new opportunity but she was not sure to be interested about the position of treasury and tax manager because she's already finance manager and she's afraid that the position we propose her is not higher. But she agreed to meet us and talk about it further.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Professional attire - well dressed, punctual and super calm
Monotone &amp; lack of emotion on face 


Ambitions and next job move

Better pay as he's got married last two months with a lady from the same industry


Reason for leaving

General Factors - left it in 2002 as the business was closed so joined the sister company - Thet Paing Soe and stick to it till now.


Motivators

Autonomy, close relationship with the management and money



Notes

I'm sure he can handle all regulatory matters although he is not from medical background.. but his communicate style will be a bit disappointing for some people- monotone and very quiet, takes some time to get his answer. Report to his MD, GM (face to face) and individual principals from France, Germany, Japan, Vietnam and Thailand through email and tele conference.

Notes

I like him - personally thinks Security Manager fits his expertise . He chose as security as his profession in 1980 as there wan't any other opportunity, but he is accountable for all the things he's done so far. Highly recommended by his colleagues. Very humble, yet detail oriented. Doesn't give promise easily. Was in charge for security during the visit of Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Hilary Clinton and John Carter. Has a wide network with the local authorities - government, police and Tatmadaw.  Knows evacuation, bomb and how to deal with armed groups. 
Now 61 years old.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Very professional and humble
Confident in his expertise and proud of his achievement throughout his career

NO INTEREST IN INSURANCE AND BANKING as it is in their early stage


Ambitions and next job move

More challenge in different industry (never go back to former industries he's worked for as he doesn't want to take down the flag he's put up for years before leaving them) 


Reason for leaving

PTTP - got offer from Faber and also felt like he reached his maturity stage in Lubricant industry
Faber Castell - got headhunted by Telenor (greenfield so he choose it)
Telenor - got headhunted by Bosch and also annoyed by customers calls (unrelated to him like sim card pick up) 


Motivators

Challenge, Exposure
Big names
Autonomy, Trust from Management and team
The level of contribution he can make
Definitely not money

Notes

Super top tier. Committed to give his best and will never leave the company until he's confident he has helped it grow and profitable. Come from a very strong family background. Has got excellent communications with ministers (including prime minster family) and ministries. Before making a decision on IT and surveillance tender projects, they reach him for an insight. His team hit 2015 annual target - 15 million USD in five months as he got Yangon International Airport surveillance project. 

Particularly, grateful to CMO from PTT for giving him practical knowledge - letting him do anything he wanted and saw the consequences without even a complaint.
Always get headhunted by MNCs. Helped market and distribute a lot of MNCs in Myanmar as an individual consulting projects.

Ambitions and next job move




Reason for leaving

Informatic Education: was more on looking for students though it's marketing, wanted more challenge

Motivators

Working with SMART people where she can grows her best
Autonomy and trust
Money


Notes

I like her personality. Very humble yet very skilled. There is only one Burmese in their company in her position herself. Since her student life, she stood out from the crowd. Love handling multiple accounts - especially international. For some clients, she has to do script writing for TVCs and commercials. Very Singaporean ....... a little bit Burmese in a good way.

Expected Salary: Negotiable (based on JDs)
Notice :  1 month, but plan to relocate only in early 2015 (Jan and Feb) as there are accounts she needs to close and family matters too."

Notes

I like him. Can be a a very good sales person with his personality. Want to be Head of Sales and Marketing. If the company cannot combine it, he won't go forwards. Doesn't like the idea of begging for budgets to Sales an if he is on Sales, trying to make up all the money spent by Marketing carelessly without any clear indication on the Sales success rate. He can balance both sides and cover the cost. 


Met with Ooredoo, Coca cola and Unilever. Ooredoo left him stranded. Saw draft offer and suddenly, they cut contact with him without any reason.  
Coca Cola thinks his expected is too much for local and they are not willing to pay unless he is an expat.
Unilever doesn't want to combine Sales &amp; Marketing position. So he didn't continue the process.


Current Salary: $ 10,000 USD gross 
Expected Salary: $ 10,000 USD Net
Notice Period: 1 Month
Date added: 2015-11-23 || Action: Prescreen || Chloe pre-screened in 2013 - good candidate back then but he has a blacklisted reference and background check from ooredoo. see contact notes. 
Date added: 2015-10-21 || Action: Outbound Call || Talked to him over the phone on 19/10/2015.
A very good candidate for Sales &amp; Marketing. Speaks perfect Burmese and super polite. Frankly and friendly at core. 

He is not interested in Non Revenue Driven Campaigns, which is good. He is on a big package right now. So he thinks it'll be unfair for him to ask for the same to a representative office like Thai Life Insurance Public Company and he is not an expert in Insurance sector at all. 

He is absolutely open to new opportunities (esp P&amp;G) related to Sales &amp; Marketing at Director Level."

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Professional attire and serious
Great communications skills, smile a lot


Ambitions and next job move

To secure a job that pushes her forward in Yangon and to pursue her MBA

Motivation

Money, money and money

Training and support


Notes

Finished LCCI diploma already
Very ambitious ….. wants to improve a lot. No doubt she can learn quickly. Has experience in Tax and Fixed assets (said defining percentage is challenging). A bit junior to take on Managerial role in big organization as Apollo. Was the first finance professional in IGT. She took 2 days leave form IGT (Mandalay) and came to Yangon just to meet us for an interview. Very committed lady. Speaks basic Chinese.

Current Salary: $ 1000 USD +Health Insurance (while working in SG)
Expected Salary: $ 1500 – 1800 USD gross
Notice Period: 1 month (can make it to 2 weeks with her annual leave)


Date added: 2015-11-13 || Action: Prescreen || Khin Soe Oo has nice smile and very charming personality.
Worked in Singapore then tried to move to another company for a better offer but got rejected because her expat license was expiring. 
Moved back to Myanmar and managed her parents' business.
Worked for IGT and did fixed assets then moved to ATM and held financial manager position. She could not fit into the culture. She was given other duties outside her area of responsibility which she could not do.
Moved back to IGT as Finance Manager and asked to be moved to Mandalay. She was looking for more challenging roles so she took the project coordination position which is a bit exciting for her. The problem is she needs to learn a lot more to advance her knowledge and skills. She wants to move back to Yangon to do her MBA or ABE so looking for a job.
skills: training assistants, accounting, tax
motivations: higher salary, learn more, challenging roles
wants to work for trading and manufacturing
problem: international companies will not believe in her abilities because she is a local.

She mentioned that she can also do treasury and taxation and is actually more interested with it if given the choice.
I would highly recommend her for either position and if she can manage both, it would be better for her and the company.

Her education background is very impressive. She has a degree in Commerce(Yangon), Accounting(UK), Business Management(UK) and currently working on her Thesis for MBA(Denmark).

As per behavior, she is very calm and has a friendly tone all throughout the conversation.

She resigned from her first company after working for over 5 years because they asked to relocate her to Nay Pyi Taw. For her present company, she said she is happy but wants to look for better opportunities to acquire new skills and experience from a different field.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Professional dress and very bubbly
A bit stubborn in a good way 
Speaks perfect Burmese and fair English 

WON'T RECOMMEND HER FOR MID LEVEL AND SENIOR LEVEL POSITIONS in MNCs


Ambitions and next job move

Want a stable and challenging job


Reason for leaving

KGL - quite unprofessional environment (management and HR is filled up by KGL family and relatives who don't have necessary skills - still hasn't got recommendation letter from them yet)
Neo - moved her to construction side due to Myitsone Dam cancellation and Chinese pulled out from the process and no budget and she has no interest in construction
Orient-Express : Her RMD contract was over and hers too



Motivators

Exposure, working with Expats
Autonomy

Notes

A very nice lady and friendly. Didn't get any impression on what she can do. Can be very good Executive Secretary and Office Manager. Not senior enough to join mid level and management positions.

Reason for leaving

YTP         : Joined Ooredoo
Ooredoo: Got headhunted by AYA and Coca Cola, felt time to explore new experience as it has got momentum in customer experience and awarded the best customer service provide in 2014 (amongst 1000 employee – 30% in customer service and 30% marketing that’s how they beat Telenor, who outsourced their CS to Blue Ocean)


Notes

Quite a good candidate. Choose AYA bank to work for as it is still in its infancy stage and she wanted to help it grow. There formed marketing team of 5 though there are 5000 workforce and report to MD. Believe getting things done with the best possible quality is what matters most. Speaks perfect English and Burmese. - Ministers called her to work for YTP in IT side but she was doing everything including hosting ceremonies as a MC. As her father is a diplomat, has got very good relationship in government. She travels with her father - lived in UK for 4.5 years and studied in India.

Motivators

Notes

Very good relationships with different ministry - while working for IGE, had to stay in Nay Pyi Daw for over 2 years on business. 
Was sent to Singapore, Japan (with minister) and Australia for training by IKBZ (Insurance and Banking Sector). Managed a team of 70 and reports to GM. She pioneered IKBZ with the directors, organised opening and recruited the team and trained them. Serve as the main contact for government related activities where expats cannot blend in. Planning to pursue MBA in finance and insurance this year at Yangon University. 

Current Salary: didn’t disclose (earning the highest salary amongst locals -equivalent to expat package).
Expected Salary: Negotiable
Notice Period: 6 months

I liked her, but she is not confident she can do it alone proving government that Thai Life will make vivid progress before June 2016 as her notice period is 6 months at IKBZ.

Special Note;
Mung Thai staffs are trained by IKBZ.

Very open-minded and easy to communicate. Taking care of marketing for both AMI branches and sponsorship (won sponsorship in B2B 30th Anniversary) and manage 12 Sales &amp; Marketing people. Enjoys customer service, face to face selling, handling complaints. 
No preference in Industry as long as she is in marketing side. AMI has given her training on Insurance side both in side and sent her to a forum in SG (a week), has taken Management studies by herself. 

I like her, but quite Junior.

In the past, she was an administrator for Capital 8 for 2 years.

Although she has these experience, it is not enough to put her into the Chief Executive Representative position. Her character is good but too soft. Also, her English is pretty good, but not excellent.

She should be able to handle more junior managerial positions."

Well dressed and punctual

I like his gut of asking Share within 10 months of joining at Telenor. Surely a good candidate but found it very difficult to communicate with. Maybe language barrier (not sure). Has been to Philippines and US on public policy studies. Quite junior ….  Did research on land policy in Myanmar and also India &amp; UK law.

Notes

Been through alot in his life ... his family separated when he reached Grade-5. Rebellious and inquisitive nature helped him survive all the way. Able to reunite his family members by Grade-11 and brought all of them to Yangon and take good care of them. 
Became a lonesome orphan in Grade-5 and started Sales. His grandma brought him to Yangon and he started working for his uncle - deal business with Wa Rebels and government and supply armory accessories - jet oil + bullet-proof vest. Had to do lots of travelling, based in Bangkok and meet international suppliers including Russian and Japanese. 

Will run his own company in 5 years time and pass on his profession to the orphans by building own orphanage. Will work only more years for corporate.

Manages 12 Managers including Area Sales Manager. Very proud working at Proximity due to the nature and unique management style. No office for each managers and no role call as they are reaching over 100 townships in Myanmar. Had 135 staffs before he joined (had 12 rounds of interview) and he fired underperforming staff and reduce the number to 83 and double the sales volume. 

CEO, himself and GM (fired already as he fired COO, John - John stood up for Sai Han Linn) and 1 more are in the management team and he is in charge of writing cheque. Wants to put Finance under a new entity so GM has autonomy up to 5 $ only and he is not happy about it. They don't give him autonomy due to lack of trust. 

Current Salary: 2500 - 3000 USD Gross + Health Benefits - check up and reimburse
Expected Salary: min 3000 USD net
Notice Period: 2 Months (no need to give notice, however he'll give 2 months as he's in charge for writing cheque) 
Date added: 2015-11-13 || Action: Email || Got replied from him.
He thinks JD is not niche for one position and he is passionate in Sales &amp; Marketing so he'd would rather be a Sales FMCG professional.

Professional Attire


Ambitions and next job move

Will start his own business in Law Advisory in maximum two years time (2017)



Reason for leaving

DFDL : too many steps for reporting line
Private Law Firm : couldn't stand unethical behaviour from the court


Motivators

Autonomy and Respect from the management team
Hates bureaucracy and long reporting line


Notes

Not open to any new opportunities. Tired of working for other people (corporate). Not very good at stress management - drinking beer and smoking although Jolyn and I were there talking to him. No doubt he is very good at government liaison and corporate laws. 
A very good person, gave us a referral- Thu Ra Zaw whom we've already interviewed and put forward. Said to be close friends.

Not open to any opportunity. 

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Great! Bubbly and precise. 
Very professional and straight-forward.



Ambitions and next job move

To follow his passion in Arts and help young legal, esp corporate law, professionals to get connected to each other and develop skills and knowledge

He is in legal field to support his family, not his passion. Still very good and knowledgeable in Legal matters.



Reason for leaving

Yusheon: No respect within the team for each other

Motivators

Respect
Big Picture
Room for growth
Close Relationship &amp; Loyalty

Notes

Too junior for Head of Legal role ... No Microfinane and banking experience ... has done some research only. 
Helped set up two offices - one in Vietnam and one in Myanmar. Did his studies in Korea for 2 years, and got job offer there to represent Yusheon in Myanmar. Were 10 in the team - &amp; he is the only Burmese legal professional, but the whole team left Yusheon due to disagreement. Yusheon  offered him double salary to stay with them. Anyway he left, due to lack of professionalism and respect.

Presentation &amp; Communications Skills

Bubbly and friendly
Over confidant (thought a bit arrogant, but not)
Professional attire (need to prepare him …. Very general answers and doesn’t hit the point at times)
Doesn’t handle … individual income tax and commercial tax


Ambitions for next job move

To be a pure legal professional instead of managing everything.


Reasons for leaving 

The Luther Law (current law firm … will leave in end of Jan if the situation doesn’t change): being forced to take up to management level, prefer to be a corporate lawyer/ litigator as his country manager is in hospital (broke his leg accidentally). Very long working hours … 10 hr per day 

Nishimura &amp; Ashai: not much work, left after reminding 6 times to the mangement
Baker &amp; McKenzie (Thai): had to came back to Myanmar as his 4 years old daughter was in severe health condition. (his manager trust him so much that 75% contract passed through him
DFDL : followed his ideal teacher (a minister) to Baker


Motivators

MONEY 
Title (pure legal position)
Enjoy travelling, but not frequently as he wants to spend time with his family
Flexibility
Providing assistants (having secretary or junior under him)


Note;

Was inspired by a book about “ the most difficult cases in the world” translated by Myanmar most well known lawyer, esp …. Suing Germany for World War II case so stepped into legal field as a litigation lawyer. Stick there for 8 years and later moved into corporate trend together with the trend.

I like his experience and confidant. But there were at time, his strong personality and arrogance make me think twice whether we’d put him forward. Said he has lots of offer from other law firms … eyes rolling (didn’t disclose which firms). Prior leaving Baker in Thai, was offered by DFDL Myanmar for Senior Associate position, but he didn’t take it as they changed the salary package when he returned.  

Current Salary: 4500$ Net + Health Insurance (700$) + 
Expected Salary: Increment
Notice Period : 2 months (1 month notice; to comply code of conduct, he’ll not work for any firm for a month)

He does not want to leave DFDL. And if possible he wants to stay there until he retires. Just a couple of months ago, he signed a 2-year contract with them. He said, maybe after that, he can move.

DFDL is his first job. said when he got the job, he had nothing and he was trained. He wants to know more so he wants to stay. asked if he will consider if another company/law firm will offer him a job with more training and more opportunities to do more, he is really not interested. he is not motivated with money or position. he has friends who went to telecoms and they are being paid a lot higher than him now, but he is not envious or anything. 
He is also not very confident with his English skills so he wants to improve it first before considering other jobs.

He is very loyal to DFDL. He said in the past 6 months, 3 other lawyers left so he needs to stay because the firm needs him. 

His other interests:

HR- he is taking up courses on the weekends for HR but does not really plan to be in HR. He is just interested in it.

English- he wants to improve for further studies in Thailand. He aims to study in Thailand because other countries are a lot more expensive.

He does not want to disclose his salary.

Music- He plays keyboard, guitar and electronic music through his computer.
His father was a retired jazz player. He does not like jazz though because it is boring.

All in all, he is a nice guy!

I appreciate being given the opportunity to speak with you about the big opportunity at your company. The job seems to be a perfect match for me. I appreciate your willingness to discuss the details of the position with me and giving time to consider your offer.

Would like to move bigger commercial banking which he can take more responsibilities 

MOTIVATIONS: Higher salary and working in international commercial banking company

Presentation and Presentation Skill

A bit talkative and goes off the topic sometimes
Knows most of key person in Banking businesses 
Not ambitious and very commercial



Reasons for Leaving

CB: wanted to move to compliance, but HR didn’t agree
Apex : didn’t pass management test (said he was too honest, didn’t copy like others so didn’t make it)
UAB: Didn’t let him join important meetings and activities
Chiyoda: to finish his MBA thesis
Asia Development Bank: Bankrupt



Motivation

Career Advancement
Working with Expatriates
MONEY … MONEY
Respect, open office culture (receptive to idea)



Note

He’s been in Banking for a long time … mostly in admin and assisting CEOs. He thinks he is overqualified, but not from my point of view. Wants to open his own bank, but he believes it’s unattainable. His wife and he worked for Apex and left at the same time as they didn’t see any future. His wife still working for UAB in the finance side. No interest in Microfinance at all ..

Likes European firms (commercial banks), especially German – no discrimination on nationality.

But he never listens and pushes the team to meet the deadline. 
Loses professionalism and face in front of his friends and business contacts as Rinat is too aggressive sometimes and changes mind so often.

Have a row with Rinat yesterday and told him he'll be leaving in June or if Rinat wants him to leave earlier, he'll leave sooner like April as he doesn't want to leave irresponsibly (10 staff now).

Ambitions and next job move

To take up to Management position in Finance Industry (if possible, not bank) and help country's development and social causes 


Reason for leaving

The bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi - Management doesn't respect local culture thus doesn't accept suggestion for strategy implementation
Bagan Capital listed in HK Stock Exchange (3% equity, he sold it with 150000 USD) - started 
Meridian - didn't like CEO (doesn't admit he doesn't know and he makes mistake)


Motivators

Contributing country's and people development
Autonomy and flexibility


Notes

I'm sure he can do the job. Need to guide him on interview process. Has 5 offers - AYA (7,000 - Corporate Banking), 
Bagan Capital (9000 - CEO), 
Meridian (6000), 
CB (6000),

Presentation and Communication Skills

Bubbly

A bit late for the meeting, but gave a call first for that

Single ladies – good with travelling jobs

Ambitions for next job move

To take on operational management positions either in INGO or corporate 
(has one offer from MFIs, but didn’t take it as they care only for benefits, one from local firms for Audit position, but ideas are not welcome so didn’t take it)





Reasons for leaving

Smart Maritime Company – not a professional environment to work with



Note

I like her. First joined as Marketing person – met 300,000 farmers across the country and had intensive interview with 600 farmers. Very confident with doing research, feasibility studies and audit. Loves turning her own ideas to actual working plans. Joined relief program after Nargis and become part of “IMPACT” team. Joined Microfinance because she saw it was necessary to help upgrade the farmers’ livelihood. Reliable and enthusiastic about her own work.

Notes

Quite like him. Very ambitious, yet content with what he has. Doing oversea exhibition for precious stones and gems for family business. Stand on his own since at the age of 18. Speaks perfect English and Burmese, fair Mandarin. Highly educated and experience in Finance. Did 2 years on BA Chemistry, left it and moved to Finance and found passion. Finish 4 years finance studies within 2.5 years due to academically intelligent and build impressive record and relationships with professor. Applied 3 uni for Master - Barkley, Tampa and one more. Chose Tampa as granted full scholarship. 
Got 2 offers upon his return - KBZ and CB. Reject KBZ as BODs and his familiar has got very good relationship. Wants to be an objective person who climb up career ladder on his own. 
Left CB coz there is no room for growth. Don't accept alternative ideas. Worked hand in hand with CEO, Dawn and Ko Zawn. Can't make decision on his own, worst of all, all the projects he initiated have to be handed over to respective department, can't see result and take ownership. Ooredoo offers him 4500 USD net. But haven't got back to them yet. There are other offers and contacts from MFIs, which he failed to answer due to the trips. Been in contact with Telenor with Treasury department, but when in charge lady left, he decided not to keep the contact. 

Last Drawn at CB: $ 4000 - 4500 USD net
Expected Salary: ideally $ 6000 (negotiable based on the role and job satisfaction ) + Health Insurance
Notice Period: 

will be on a trip from 23 - 28 Dec, 30 Dec 2015 - 14 Jan 2016 - gem exhibition and family trip in Europe

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Friendly and bubbly
Professional and precise, very straightforward
Excel in culinary arts, expert in American food
Passion in F&amp;B



Ambitions and next job move

To explore further and contribute his skills, ideally in a hotel as he wants to focus more on the menu developing concepts
Doesn't mind working in boutique restaurant chains (multiple outlets) as long as it has clear line of communication and idea receptive
 

Reason for leaving

Porter house by Laris (still working here): shareholders keep changing mind, one person say he wants this and the other said another, no clear instruction
Dining Concepts:  heard like chief chef always turn down his creation without any reason and he would never develop anything good (didn't hear it well, very bad internet reception - dropped 5 times)
Caesar Palace: Wanted to have Asia experience and take more challenge
Bradley Odgen : To explore more and take one step further


Motivators

Autonomy and Trust in his work or creation
Clear communication and clear instruction
Responsibilities and encouraging environment
Money


Notes

I quite like him. He hasn't got a Skype ID yet. So talked to him over the phone and the line dropped 9 times in 20 mins. Very bad internet reception from our side, couldn't hear him well. No doubt he is a very good chef and creative in developing menu. Has won multiple awards, pioneer founder of Bradley Odgen.

Date added: 2016-11-07 || Action: Outbound Call || Called to explore if he would be interested in the Head of Risk role at Finstar. He said no as he din't have a good view on the company and the ethical nature of its operations. He is currently in a consultancy role with KBZ and would be open to considering suitable roles with big international names like ANZ, Standard Chartered, etc.
Date added: 2016-02-02 || Action: Outbound Call || Had AYA Group dinner on 30/1/2015 at Novotel and he was advised he'll get promoted to big title for the whole AYA Finance Group (Banking, Insurance and Securities) and asked him to wait it happen before April. Until then, he won't be going anywhere unless he gets 6000 USD net. If Finstar does PE, he is more than interested. If it's MFI, then he will not consider. 
Date added: 2015-12-30 || Action: Outbound Call || Met with Dino yesterday and a short conversation with him. Not really impressed with meeting a local. I think it's because he was expecting to meet a European. Takes particular pride in being an American and having knowledge in risk matter more than Dino. 

He misunderstood Dino as not having the authority to make a decision. I noticed both of their Burmese is not very good while I met them separately. 

Willing to go forward if Finstar offer can match his expected salary - 6000 USD Net. Will work minimum 1 year.... Have some doubt on Finstar .. they invest heavily on large scale world wide and they enter Myanmar under MFI as Microfinance. He believes Finstar will kick out Dino and put someone like him in charge after all the foundations are done. Not a good thing to mention to a recruiter. 

Will have culture clash if we put them together.


Date added: 2015-12-16 || Action: Email || Met him on 16/12/2015. Interested to go forward. Sent Introduction about Finstar on 17/12/2015.

Presentation and Communication Skills

I quite like him.
Professional and positive attitude
Smart body posture
Humble and very clever at answering questions
Concern that Russian are not usually transparent in financial statement (convinced him already it won’t be the case as Nick Jordan is now CEO of Finstar Group)


Ambition for next job move

Contributing his skills and expertise towards the communities and country



Reasons for leaving



Motivator

Company vision and clear roadmap
Working closely with decision maker
Autonomy
Idea receptive environment
Money


Note

Company’s vision and roadmap matter most. Wants to be a part of developing and reform process. Very good Burmese and English. Knowledgeable in banking and finance. Still has Myanmar NRC and US passport. Immigrated to US at the age of 12 with the whole family. Moved to Myanmar with his wife – no children. Has heard that he’ll be in charge of Risk matters for the whole AYA group – very happy at his current jobs in terms of contribution and spearheading risk department. Worked in DC for 15 years, proud to be an American and loves Myanmar too. 


When he returned Myanmar - Met KBZ
Yoma – got offer, almost signed but didn’t as AYA’s chairman – U Zaw Zaw personally explained him the vision of AYA bank and that completely got his attention. Deloitte (Singapore) has done auditing, need only singed approval now. Got IFRC – the only one that has got so far in Myanmar. 
No written contract with AYA, but Zaw Zaw requested him to work with him for at least 4 years.

He is very passionate in Marketing and advertising but in FnB or FMCG.
He lacks English Skills and admitted it and probably that is why his communication/ how he presents himself is affected. He is taking English classes though at the moment and said his current company, although he does not enjoy the position as much as doing Marketing, he is improving his English and communications skills because of being exposed to a foreign boss.
Although I met him for the Marketing Manager position for Finstar, i am not submitting him because it is not clearly his interest.

Date added: 2015-12-28 || Action: Prescreen || Axel has very good communication skills and excellent English.

He is now working for Yangon Property Management which is under Green Vision Myanmar. He is currently the Building Manager. 
He started working at a large bookstore in Yangon doing sales, marketing and business development. Then he moved to Star City which is under Yoma Strategic Holdings, where he worked as a Senior Executive in customer service.

He enjoys a lot facing customers and dealing with their problems. He also enjoys doing sales, marketing and BD. What he looks for in another job is training and career development.

She has been doing sales and marketing, but she is more inclined to sales. She is willing to move to another company but not until end of March next year because she made a commitment with her current job. She is more interested going into real estate because that is what she has been doing for the past couple of years and she enjoys it a lot. She can consider going into other industries but that depends on the duties and responsibilities that comes with the job. She will move in if it will advance her career not let her start from the very beginning.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Great
Patient 
Impressive Burmese


Ambitions and next job move

Better package that matches market rate


Reason for leaving

Digicel: the whole team relocated to Ooredoo as Digicel didn't won the license for Tower
PARK Royal: ..... (didn't record it) sth like she got a divorce with her husband and helped out NLD projects to get donors - like HP for computer- and put in contact with Digicel
SEA Consortium: returned Myanmar, dad passed away on cancer
Hnin Thitsa: was helping an acquaintance


Motivators

Big Name (PR active)
Autonomy
Package and stability (being a single mom of 4 years son and taking care of her own mother)

Notes

Very good candidate from a diplomatic background and military too. Grandpa was U Nu's right hand. Dad was an ambassador who set up Embassies in 3 foreign countries - Brazil, Belgium &amp; 1 other country speaking Portuguese. She followed her dad. So had to leave her University and continue on her return. Did her Dip in Business in Australia and French courses. Worked in Singapore, got married with her friend there, got PR. But gave up on her return to Myanmar to take care of her mother after dad passed away. 
Got intensive PR training and techniques from a foreign expert while at Digicel and in Ooredoo too ( to tackle hyper sensitive religious group in Myanmar). Hired Ex-General Khin Nyunt right hand as security for ease communication with government and to compete license with the competitor.

When she was about to leave from Digicel, got offer from YOMA and met with Andrew Richard and Melvyn Pun. Couldn't join as YOMA and Digicel has not taking partner's staff.

Took over CSR foreign expert team and managing PR team (1 content writer + hired 1 reporter for press release + 1). Salary is stagnant as Ooredoo offered the same package as Digicel to all the staff. 

Met with Fullerton Myanmar last month to learn about the micro-finance industry and their operations. She is amazed by their loan return rate. Ooredoo is also doing Microfinance for Women. Impressive Career Record ....
Current Salary: 2200 USD Net + Insurance (Netstar)+50$ per day - travel allowance+14 days Annual Leave. 

Expected Salary: Market Rate (she knows it's double what she is receiving. She has already submitted to double her salary as her responsibility doubled to Ooredoo &amp; they asked her to wait till end of Jan. If it isn't happening , she'd submit resign letter and join another company)
Notice Period: 2 Months (local gov law 1 month) ... She still has 10 days annual leave

MOTIVATIONS: MNCs, big name and title 

REASON FOR LEAVING: Being headhunted by DKSH.

NOTES: He suits the position of Anti-fraud for Finstar, which is his expertise. He knows what he is good at and knows his step. A bit bubbling and hard to cut off the conversation. He once got an offer from Rocher at 3,500 USD but he denied because Roche is a partner with DKSH. He has concerns on his current company not to join a partner.

Notes

I like him. A bit arrogant, need to adjust that one in order to fit in with organisations. Have in depth experience in internal &amp; external audit, Fraud Investigation and Compliance. Giving training to over 2000 DKSH country wide in Myanmar and check up timely - bimonthly, quarterly and annually based on urgency. 
Reports to Governance Compliance Committee in Singapore. No one in Myanmar is reporting to him. Works as a Individual Full Time Consultant in Compliance matter and hand in hand with Legal Counsel and Country Committee - a group of Management team - like VP, P and CM. Core person for setting Code of Conduct including whistle blowing and Anti-Bribery. 

Got offer from Roche - 3500 USD gross but didn't accept it
and from an agency, Middle East based, didn't accept it as they didn't disclose client's name

Current Salary: Around 2500 USD gross + retention benefits (DKSH can pay for house and car purchasing charges in advance and he can pay back little by little)
Expected Salary: Negotiable (reasonable increment)
Notice Period: 1 Month
Date added: 2016-01-08 || Action: Outbound Call || Not interested in Banking and Insurance, too complicated at the moment. Will go deeper into compliance side for MNCs - interested in FMCG and Pharmaceutical. Taught at BARS for 5 yrs : 2005 -2010. Will consider only HEAD OF positions - 
especially Governance Compliance Management. A lot of recruitment firms from oversea and local chased after him, without brining any value to him, only to get salary information."

Knows inside out about Media Relations. Writes blogs and articles and sell them. Arrange exclusive events for sailors or anyone for 40 -60 people anywhere in Myanmar. 
Has Media network in Yangon, Mandalay, Mawlamyine and one more. Has built very good relationship with national TV channels, radio stations and agencies. 

Need to brush his English. He admits his English is not good enough to be an Account Director level. Can handle all the responsibilities, but not misunderstanding due to language barrier. He knows Andreas Soe Thu (Current Account Director).  Said he is first generation and the best local PR person, but himself is the third generation. Has worked with Zagar on a project before (I forgot which one).

Date added: 2015-12-29 || Action: Email || email from Natasha re her salary:

Right now my salary is 20.000 RMB per month (that would be 2808 Euro more or less ).

The benefits I have are

-2 international airplane tickets to book within one year, economy class.

-Health insurance

-21 days of holidays and in case of need, non paid leave

-visa fees paid by the company

 

Right now I would like to keep at list on this range of salary.

But there are many factors that I am open to discuss.

For example I can compromise on the currency my salary can be paid. Or if there are some fiscal benefits for the company I can compromise on the salary accepting instead a house allowance or a training course bonus to get one other Master degree while I am in Myanmar.

Every nation has its own market rules, so I am willing to follow your advises concerning the salary availability of the Myanmar companies.


Date added: 2015-12-29 || Action: Prescreen || Natasha has an excellent communications skills and speaks English excellently in her Italian accent. She can alto also speak fluent Chinese.

She went to China from uni to work during the 2008 Olympic games as a translator for an Italian television. 
She stayed on in China an worked at an Italian Co based in China with funding from Japan. She did training to staff, HR and event coordinating.
She moved into the school she is working in now as a Director. She is doing all admin jobs including providing visas to foreign teachers and students who are going to study in Italy which amounts to 800,000 students per year.

She will be leaving by the end of March next year because the government policy is changing. They want senior level positions to be held by Chinese nationals. Also her boyfriend's company in China is closing so they are looking into other countries where they can have career growth.

Don't contact him for any job - prefer to be in his own business. Very good with civil and criminal law. Never done corporate law and never worked for anyone. Can do legal drafting only in Myanmar and knows the law quite well. Knows very basic English. Had only 10 mins chat with him and asked referrals who he thinks can be a good fit.

Not a good candidate at all. We've interviewed his colleagues and he asked him about Aquila. 
Takes care of MIC, registration and corporate secretaries. More like a local market intelligence who knows the process inside out. Reports to his MD - Alex Bouch. Very happy at Luther due to family type operations and trust. Not interested to move into any company at the moment. Luther told him he'll get MD position in the long run if he stick to them.

Date added: 2016-10-18 || Action: Outbound Call || BD Call: She said she is helping set up the HR Structure Bluewave broadband and Kia Motors - both her friend's companies. At the moment they are not looking into filling up senior level positions until they are properly set up. She will let me know and if she is not in the company anymore, she would recommend Aquila to her friend.

Her contract with them is temporary and she has 1.5 months left to decide if she will stay longer or not. 
She wants to join companies from UK, US or Singapore, not from China or Korea because of the culture. 
She is also looking for the same position as she has now or higher.

She left SPA because was so bored. She is looking for challenge and wants a fast-paced environment. She came from emergency - paced environment so the culture in SPA does not fit her.
The company shareholders are very rich so it is very stable and they do not have a real competition.

Knows SAP, thinks Sage is not compatible with Myanmar as it follows UK instruction.

Will stick with AGD for a while. 
Her mom has heart failure (one pump is open) so wants to take care of her and does not want to take leave at the beginning of joining a new company. 

Don't like fisheries, beverages and tobacco companies.

Looking for a new job as her new MD - Htet Tay Za doesn't see her as an asset unlike his new MD, who acknowledge her effort and contributions for the growth of the company.

Date  : 4/2/2016

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Professional and ambitious
Enthusiastic and realistic
Punctual and repectful


Ambitions and next job move

Take up GM position by end of 2016



Reason for leaving

NEX4: his CEO was very supportive, never take no for an answer, left it as he wanted to do more than engineering
Max: went to Singapore to get a job (extending stay permit got rejected; had to miss all 3 interviews)



Motivators

Company Vision &amp; direction
Career Growth
His ability to contribute company's success
Stability of the company


Notes

Great personality with positive mentality and can-do attitude. Has got offer from Ooredoo, KDDI and Blue Ocean while applying for jobs. Choose Blue Ocean as it was a local start-up company which can offer him autonomy and responsibilities. Got 1500 USD gross offer from KDDI (no autonomy), 1200 from Ooredoo (doesn't like it). 
Proud of being able to set up call centre for Telenor by himself with his team amongst many challenges and sleepless nights. Has to travel to Mandalay to open new branch for IT infrastructure. Been to Bangkok on business and Japan on conference (Blue ocean paid for it - CEO invited him for dinner when he told him he'll be leaving the company and explained about his vision for the company asking him to stick with them and he paid for the trip as soon as he heard he wants to join).

Current Salary: 1000 USD gross
Expected Salary: Negotiable (he knows he can get between 1200 &amp; 1500)
Notice Period: 1 Month"

said am lucky i contacted her when she was frustrated because otherwise she would have ignored me as other headhunters who tried to contact her.
Frustrated because she kept on training/ telling the same people what and how to do the same things every time.
Worked for Myanmar Brewery for 20 years and feels like they are family. Likes it that the working hours are flexible and the package they have for senior positions are excellent.
Interested though with new opportunities as she doesn't want to get stuck in the same role for the rest of her life. She would like to do new and more strategic approaches and training more than what she is doing now. She reached the highest position she can have as an HR in the company.
She prefers other industry since she is a religious  person(Buddhist) . Also, they have in their contract not to work for a competitor 1 year after leaving their job. If there is a post at a financial institution, she would like to try as she had not experienced yet. Otherwise, any other industry is good.

Date added: 2016-02-04 || Action: Prescreen || Name: Khun Kaung Htet
Date  : 5/2/2016

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Very positive and proactive 
Professional and respectful
Did Phone Interview (he is based in Mandalay)


Ambitions and next job move

Has interest in corporate more than general practitioner


Reason for leaving

Neo Nokia Mobile: own business (rent got higher and also got married in Mandalay so relocated there with his family)

MobileMate: one of the shareholders misused the fund for other projects (rice import &amp; export) and do not reimburse 


Motivators

Autonomy
Transparency


Notes

I quite like him. Informative and straightforward. Came to Yangon to take care of his brother who was back then studying while trying to go oversea. His friend asked him to work for Mobile mate and promoted him to GM due to his performance. Put some of his money as capital and become the shareholder, majority is owned by his friend (80%). Later, his friends invested the fund in other project (rice import &amp; export) without giving back the loan so they departed, started his business - Neo Nokia. 

Has 1.5 years old kid. His wife working and studying in Mandalay. So he's taking care of kid, work as general practitioner and involve in his extended family business - realeaste in Pyin Oo Lwin. 

Sound very enthusiastic to come to Yangon if his family allows. 

Been to Thai, Vietnam and Singapore on business (was illegal back then to bring in handsets) - imported CDMA 450 with different techniques. More like an importer than the retail. Had 4 people, 3 in Yangon and 1 in Mandalay. Left his own company as he was discouraged with the situation amongst shareholder and government's slow movement towards giving license to telecom operators.

His friend (former shareholder) is doing fine now.


Current Salary : doing his own business

doing business development for Winner Inn-Family business together with his sister. Parents are semi-retired. 
first 2 years working for winner inn, dramatic development, then came competition.
partly owns the press office cafe, will open 2 more soon; helped his father open stock brokerage in singapore.

Is interested in investing into real estate - commercial and industrial, infra, mining, farming

Will work for an international company because of a clear system/strategy.
Father has connections with government now so it was easy for him to work on documents, registrations and the like for winner inn and the press office cafe.. worried that there would be a change in the government seat so if he works for another company and he is asked to work on documents with the government, it will not be easy as how he did before.

i believe he is capable, but he is a bit concerned that the role for Marga has got big responsibilities.. interested but he needs to think about it.

English and communication skills are excellent! with commercial voice and face, too!

Date added: 2016-08-24 || Action: Left Message || Hello Ms. Jolyn,
 
Thanks for your invitation.I would like to move if really have a good change for me.
 
Good Change I mean is
1) Greater Position
2) Higher Salary
 
1) Position 
 
Now, I am handling the Retail Marketing Department of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for the IT and Mobile Division.
Position and Head of Retail Marketing. ( HOD )
 
If the client can offer VP or Director Position...I am interested in that.
 
2) Remuneration
 
My Current remuneration a month is ~5000 USD after tax and exclude the quarterly incentive and annual bonus.
If we can hit the sellout target, quarterly incentive is 2x of salary and annul bonus also around there.
So total annual package is around 120 K  ( 60000 Basic + 60000 Incentive and Bonus )
 
If the Client can offer more than that, I am interested in.
 
Please let me know your idea, should I come and see you tomorrow or not???
 
 
Thanks,
 
Tint Lwin Htwe

I had a good time with Jon this morning. He seemed like a nice guy. Liverpool's fan :) I am Man Utd though. 

So yeah he was putting up high level ideas to engage iflix in Myanmar market and asking me if I am capable of bring the actual ideas to iflix as a lead in Myanmar. Due Diligence on Blink, Rocket internet and nex as well. Meeting went well. I gave him the ideas on how to tackle the issues of piracy, challenges on reliable data to engage marketing campaigns and business setup. I do hope I was a fruitful candidate for him. 

He said he will get back to you on Monday about this meeting since he has to go to Hanoi this evening for the launch next month. Meanwhile, I am to in touch with him online (LinkedIn) or his contact number. So I quickly sent him LinkedIn follow up message. But he hasn't accepted me yet on LinkedIn. Could you ask him to accept me, first? He thought we are already connected. Thank you. 

And now I am preparing stuffs to meet Viber. Thank you for the big opportunities. 

I do love to explore more on iflix as well as it is still in my rader and things I love to work with. If both turns out well, it would be a tough choice indeed coming.

Date added: 2015-11-22 || Action: Client Visit || Met San San Myint with Jolyn. She didn't understand why we contacted her so she brought her colleague, Yin Yin Han with her. So couldn't say any specific on the reasons meeting her. Instead, made it as a client visit saying we wanted to meet them in order to learn about the services they offer and how they are different from other legal firms. 
LS Horizon is based in Thai and most of their clients are from Thai and some from Europe. Both San San Myint Wai (Susan) and Yin Yin Han are recruited by LS horizon directly right before they opened office in Myanmar and they know inside out about the business. 
San San - Very good with Myanmar laws, over 20 years of experience

Yin Yin - very good relationship with MIC process

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Professional
Straightforward and quick decision maker
Well dressed and punctual



Ambitions and next job move

To take up to IT manager and consultant position


Reason for leaving

RMA (headhunted by Aeon): CFO and CEO didn't promoted him to AM position and gave only 100000 MMK raise though he was taking care of Manager's responsibility once he got fired by the company. RMA offered another junior person Manager position ... from his point of view the guy had good relationship with the management and he has been at the group for a long time

CB (headhunted by RMA) : got offer (3 times higher) from RMA group - let CB knew about it, negotiated ..... can't give the same offer due to bank's structure on seniority

Motivators

Room for growth
Working with decisive and smart people
Autonomy
Title and big names



Notes

Very good personality. Speaks fluent Burmese, Chinese &amp; professional English. Bubbly and informative. Knows what is good at and the sales pitch. Travel throughout Myanmar while working for CB (it opened 4 branches nationwide per day/ week - I don't remember well). Trained the junior staff.

With a corporate background and seventeen years of experience working in the philanthropic field, Cristina provides long-term strategy services to individuals and family foundations. She believes that impact can often be achieved by combining fast-moving, innovative approaches with concrete investments and solid due diligence. Given that an important part of strategic philanthropy is to prepare the next generation, Cristina works constantly to create opportunities and tools so young men and women can capitalize on their own resources, skills and interests.

A passionate entrepreneur, Cristina started her first business in high-school and believes that success is often found at the intersection of vision and practicality. Blending business acumen with a commitment to social issues, she operates in two distinct areas: philanthropy advisory services and management consulting for non-profits and social entrepreneurs. 

As a way to give back, Cristina often shares insights from the trenches, speaking publicly three times a year about the art and science of philanthropy. 

Cristina holds a BS in Economics, a BA in Psychology and an MBA, currently chairs a non-profit board and mentors two foster youth. In her spare time, she is a particle physics aficionado, a writer and a photographer.

With a corporate background and seventeen years of experience working in the philanthropic field, Cristina provides long-term strategy services to individuals and family foundations. She believes that impact can often be achieved by combining fast-moving, innovative approaches with concrete investments and solid due diligence. Given that an important part of strategic philanthropy is to prepare the next generation, Cristina works constantly to create opportunities and tools so young men and women can capitalize on their own resources, skills and interests.

A passionate entrepreneur, Cristina started her first business in high-school and believes that success is often found at the intersection of vision and practicality. Blending business acumen with a commitment to social issues, she operates in two distinct areas: philanthropy advisory services and management consulting for non-profits and social entrepreneurs. 

As a way to give back, Cristina often shares insights from the trenches, speaking publicly three times a year about the art and science of philanthropy. 

Cristina holds a BS in Economics, a BA in Psychology and an MBA, currently chairs a non-profit board and mentors two foster youth. In her spare time, she is a particle physics aficionado, a writer and a photographer.

A bit nervous, Quite bubbly and straightforward. 
Last drawn: $ 3000 USD Net
ES: $ 4000 USD Net
NP: Immediately available.
Date added: 2016-02-28 || Action: Prescreen || PRESENTATION AND COMMUNICATION:
Good at explaining his overview with examples but a bit bubbly.

AMBITIONS FOR NEXT ROLE: Role that can make decision
Industry - FMCG/ Telecom/ Service Industry
He won't go Real estate/ Financial/ Hospitality industry

MOTIVATIONS:
Systematic organization
Company which accept and be adaptable with moving trend
To establish happy environment 
To help his team improved

REASON FOR LEAVING: Wants to leave Nestle - after 6 months probation - there is no appreciation for achievement
- No good retention for senior level
Left AB Food because of Political conflicts in Myanmar which made the company shrink the organization
Left Walco - His father has got stroke and no one to take care of him except him. He has to sit at Pyin Ma Pin Factory which is very far away so he left Walco
Left BAT and Wyndham Asia for his career enhancement.

NOTES: 
HH by Chaw Su Han, West Indochina - Trade Marketing Manager
Min Khaung, My Jobs - National Sales Manager

1998 - He passed matriculation exam and started his sales passion and sells vegetable nearby his home.

He is an achievement- oriented and a team player

Helped MB Biscuits for 6 months - at that time, he made the sales revenue to increase from 780 lkhs to 1700 lakhs. 

In Nestle, he is responsible for 57 SKUs with MegaLife in 2013
Currently, he is on 33 SKUs for MDG and 21 SKUs for pet food

Back in 1996, he was the same position as U Aung Moe Kyaw. Now AMK is the chairman of the largest spirit company, so he feel embarrassed for his current position if it compares to U AMK. 

For ethical matter, he prefers doing for diary products, when I tried to sell Friesland.

Amongst the three roles he's been HH, Friesland becomes the top choice of him.

CURRENT: 2,400,000 Ks Net + 640,000 Ks for Car + 2,500,000 Ks Per Year for medical allowance _ 140,000 Ks/ month for fuel + 40,000 Ks for mobile top up card

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Friendly and informative
Straightforward
Arrived 10 mins before the meeting
Need to inform her to dress up for CCM


Ambitions and next job move

To take up to management position in consumer electronics (big brands only)

Reason for leaving

Acer (currently working here) : not much autonomy and nt supportive, her director (principal) doesn't deliver the promise to distributors and she loses her face
Sumsung: headhunted by Acer, didn't like new management (blaming system)-  a lot of local management staff left too
TMW - wanted to learn more



Motivators

Big names
Autonomy and supportive environment
Room for growth
Commute Convenience (lives in Insein)

Notes

I like her, but need to prepare her for CCM. No pitching answers throughout the interview and I know she can do what it takes. Dealt directly with foreign principals for Samsung and Acer. Been to Bkk more than a couple of times on business meeting. Particularly proud of restructuring for SMART dictionaries and payment. Prepared stock list for the company and suggested new stocks to fill in. 
Said she has been scolded a lot in Sumsung by the foreign directors as they didn't know the local culture. Suggested to do promo - Chelsea ticket when they complain about a decline in Samsung TV sales. It happened and marketing completed it and sales in ICT shows.

Date added: 2016-08-17 || Action: Outbound Call || Calling her for final interview for trade marketing role.
She is currently on holiday as her sister from Germany is in the country. 
She will check her schedule but best times would be lunch break and after 5:30 pm.
Date added: 2016-07-15 || Action: Outbound Call || Willing to wait for IBTC's decision.

Date added: 2016-06-24 || Action: Inbound Call || After CCM with IBTC: She met with the CEO, Sanjay, the head of  Sales and someone else (a local who is also in position). 
It was strange (even for me) that they did not talk to her about the trade marketing manager role. It was like an interview for another job -- modern trade, account manager. They asked the same things as the first interview-- her past jobs and her knowledge on modern trade. She was there fully prepared for an offer or a final meeting for the Trade Marketing role that she was put forward for. She said it was ok, but she was really confused. If she had known earlier, she would have prepared also. She knows little of modern trade and she was caught off guard.

She is asking if they are going to offer her  the trade marketing role and what is the real deal.
Told her, I am going to ask Vivek and get back to her.
Date added: 2016-06-23 || Action: Outbound Call || When informed about the meeting with the CEO she asked if it is the final interview. I answered it is likely because it is with the CEO but not 100% sure.
Anyway, she was ok with everything and is very willing to go forward.

Likes Carlsberg because of its international brand and management that brings about standard - SOP, so she can learn a lot.
Likes to work within FMCG companies with international brands.
Sister, Su Yadanar works for IBTC as Brand Executive.

CS: 2,600,000 MMK net
B: car(being discussed), taxi and phone allowance, medical expenses.
ES: will send together with CV
NP: 1 month 
Date added: 2016-03-09 || Action: Outbound Call || sent email and accepted invitation for meeting. would have to go close to where she works because she cannot leave her office and she is not available after office hours.
Date added: 2016-03-08 || Action: Outbound Call || quite cold in the beginning, but after knowing i am from an executive search she became warmer and apologized saying she was just surprised i was calling her via the office phone number.

Presentation and Communications Skills

Humble
Pleasant personality
Attentive and professional 

Ambitions for next job move

To explore more and gain more knowledge


Reasons for leaving

Crystal Springs: got offer from Coca-cola



Motivation

Room for growth
Trainings
Big Names
Working with SMART people


Note

Very good personality. Doesn’t mind working on Saturday. Involves a lot in training and development, rather than recruitment. Didn't get bonus last year due to turn over rate. Said she can't control it and guarantee people won't leave, out of her reach. HR from JJ Pun + 2 more firms approached her directly for opportunities. Not very positive about JJ Pun so many rounds of interview. HR provides training and development to the staff and other department. However, she herself never gets to attend anything so not moving up quickly and don't have succession plan for BP.

Travels to Nay Pyi Daw (banking), Thai, Singapore and Vietnam on own business 


Ambitions and next job move

Motivators

Big Names

Autonomy
Money


Notes

I am not quite sure whether she is assertive enough to take up Head of Operations position. 
Started from Junior bank assistant and promoted rapidly over 10 times amongst her senior to reach Deputy General Manager position. Directly report to MD. Ethical down to earth and have a sense of giving back to community.
Recruiter from SG has approached her for Head of Operations last year. Back then he said solid no. But she chased her down to Sg trip asking her CV to meet with her boss. 
Now she has a trustworthy person (her friend) to hand over family business and take over all the operation stuffs. Haven't thought of working for any company yet. 

MOB MD keeps calling her.

Last drawn as DGM 2 years ago: 900,000 MMK Net
Expected salary: 1,500,000 MMK (negotiable depend on the responsibility)
Notice Period: 3 Months - need to pay 3 times salary as fine if don't serve the notice period"

Ambitions and next job move

Reason for leaving

Jumped from industry to industry as she is much of a challenge seeker and loves autonomy



Motivators

CHALLENGES
Autonomy
Convenience for the whole family (have two kids - daughter 15 years, and son under 12)


Notes

I quite like her.  A bit show off and boastful. I'd say over confident. Has too much power on the staff and company shareholders ... but they love her as she delivered quality in te workplace. Work side by side with Melvin Pun for all the Yoma Strategic holding business - Star City, Pun Hlaing Hospital and Golf. Initialled hired her to take on Risk matters and has given her more responsibilities - now in charge of 6 categories under Risk. Had a plan to leave Myanmar last year, 2015 ... but didn't return to Australia due to the request of the company and her daughter said she can go and study there alone.  Again, it's negotiable. Earning more than expat.

Current Salary: over 20,000 USD Net + a house in Inya Rd + School fees for the kids + Insurance + FRC 
Expected Salary: Negotiable
Notice Period: Negotiable (Told YOMA she will give one year notice if she plans to leave)."

Can commit only 1 year as he'll have to go back to the U.S

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Assertive and Professional
Knows his strength quite well
Uplifting personality and open-minded
Been in investigation (tracking money trails for banks - assigned by US government for sanction matters) field for a very long time
Knows inside out about compliance 



Ambitions and next job move

To work in a firm that is not on the blacklisted like current firm (Max - AYA securities) for a year before he moves back to U.S (Got green-card last month, December 2015 and married to a US citizen)



Reason for leaving

AYA Bank (current firm): on US sanction list
Norwegian Embassy, US. Embassy: double taxation (US &amp; Myanmar)- cut 40% of the total income


Motivators

Autonomy 
Money


Notes

Will leave AYA as all the BoD will be given equity/ shares in New Year  (5 K or 10 K current worth shares). He can't take it and he must leave it as MAX is on US gov Sanction List.

Speciality lies in setting up companies for Nordic countries, economic and policy advisory for US Embassy Myanmar and money trail tracking for different companies assigned by U.S government in the U.S while working for THINK TANK. Served in Myanmar Army for sometime and both expelled and left it as he is a minority group, Shan and his relatives are in the high rank in Shan Rebel Group. Went to U.S and graduated from Hawaii. Knows all the strong local authority ... share Burmese and learn Chinese from current Chinese Ambassador. Frequently in contact with Ministry of Finance on business matters. Said finance policy will change in April, knows only central committee in NLD. So is a bit cautious about it. 

Built up the AYA securities from the scratch. Joined it in 1/2015 as Zaw Zaw promised he won't interfere in daily operations. Started registration and licensing from Feb - Nov 2015, received license in December 2015. Only 4 securities license issue - AYA, CB, KBZ and DaiWa. Works hand in hand with Dai Wa throughout the process. His colleague is a Japanese.
Speaks basic Japanese, Chinese, Shan, and fluent English and Burmese. 

Works with Cronies but is a strong NLD supporter. Tried to compete for parliamentary seat for 2015 election, but couldn't do it as his wife is American. 

Talking to World Bank and Young Investment Group (making package offer to him and his Japanese colleague from AYA Trust). Told him not to choose YIG is he has other options.


Current Salary: $43,000 USD net + Car &amp; a driver (pay in Norwegian Embassy was $49,000 USD Net)
Expected Salary: Match to his current salary
Notice Period: will leave AYA by end of April  (will be in U.S from 3-21 April)"

Notes

I like him. Ambitious and proud of achievement and the process. Assigned to do a network installation project on his own within 3 months of joining Future Tech. He did the drawing and presentation and that client became regular client of 
Daewoo screened profiles of Future Tech staff (40) and chose him to join them as IT technician. He manages 4 (rotate) IT help desks. Deal with Korean expats for IT related matters, send help desks first if there is any complaint. If it doesn’t go well, he meets them and tackle it. If he needs help, reach out to his IT coordinator and manager for additional help.

Wants to be a competent IT network engineer in 3 years time. Not shy away from deadlines and pressure as long as it pushes him to reach his full potential.

Interested in working with 
•	Telenor
•	Huawai for networking side.

She is happy to accept a part time consultancy post at IBTC also and will go full time next year.

- process was too long
- they said it was a 5 year plan for her to become CPO
- wasnt sure about going into alcohol as it could damage her reputation
- she quite wants t open her own coffee shop in pwin oo lwin as well as start a training school for HR in mandalay

- she was tempted by the following:
- having one last flag in her career at director and c-level before she moves out of yangon
- being able to become CPo within a couple of years rather than 5
- starting the grand royal university
- being part of the company that chnages the way alcohol if perceived in myanmar, being that chnage that she wants to see
- working closely with the board of TPG  will be like the old days for her at Schneider electric when she used to have the opportunity to train and work closely with the board of the company at different conferences around the world.

Date added: 2016-03-10 || Action: Outbound Call || After CCM call: she wants to work for the company but is concerned about the succession plan. She wants to know if she can have a higher role within a few years. The reason is that she has been doing the same as what they are offering for quite a while already and she needs more exposure to new challenges.
She has already advised her employer that she is leaving. She decided to leave whether or not she will be hired by IBTC. The reason is she wants a break from what she is doing since she has been working so hard for a long time. If IBTC offers her the job, it would at least be different environment and different people so she will take it.

Technovision: joined Premium as his former close collegue asked him to join interview and is employed by Premium (JV of City Mart and Sojitz)


Motivators

Working with SMART people (told me about his friend, younger yet more skilled as he was trained by Ukraine experts in his job)
Room for growth



Notes

I like him. Knows what he is good at and market situation. Now doing all the IT related matters with an assistant. Japanese Supervisor is not supportive at all. Does not welcome suggestion and not willing to take risk either - Mingalar Zay Fire, had one of their Relay Point is routed that way and was destroyed by the fire. He suggestion that Japanese to have some back up or strong system, but he didn't listen. Not willing to raise his salary and keeps comparing with unskilled labor's income. 

Meeting with interviewers in order to learn if he is ready for any challenge. Has one offer from Shopping Mall in Pegu, but doesn't have much room for growth. He'll be the manager and train the team. 

He is doing Google Native Ads business with his friend from UK. Use his friend's Visa card and gives him commission. Put the app on Google Play and generate the income from Ads, which is highly seasonal and write application for Football live stream and link it with Thai Channel for user interface .. the link works only in football season. Will complete MBA by end of 2016.


Current Salary: 400,000 MMK Gross

Date added: 2016-08-15 || Action: Outbound Call || itw went well, she needs a JD for the role before she can accept, will come back to vivek
Date added: 2016-08-02 || Action: Outbound Call || Given her a few calls to keep her warm, willing to resign without the offer, will get her to meet vivian this week and hopefully should go t offer
Date added: 2016-07-07 || Action: Outbound Call || Called her back to cancel the meeting with Vivian because she is flying out of Myanmar and has to reschedule when she returns.
Su Myat Hla said it is ok. Next week, she will be in Yangon the whole week and the week after, she will be in Nay Pyi Taw but might be back on the Friday. On the days she is in Yangon, she is available for a meeting.
Date added: 2016-07-06 || Action: Outbound Call || Called to set a meeting with her and Vivian on 8 July at 8am. She said she is going to a workshop, but can go late of it is the only time to meet with Vivian. Suggested Sedona Hotel or Fujihouse so it will be on the way to the training school where she is going, but is open to other locations.
Date added: 2016-06-23 || Action: Outbound Call || Spoke ti Vivek over the phone: 
I asked him about Su Myat Hla and the position and he said they are not going to pursue her for now. There is nothing wrong with her -- she is smart and intelligent; however TPG is on the process of restructuring and reshuffling so the Corporate Secretary role is on hold and he does not know for how long. It might take long. Ask if they will consider her for other roles, he said not for now. So he told me to tell her she is out of the list for now, and it is nothing against her.

I haven't sent Su Myat Hla any message yet.
Date added: 2016-06-23 || Action: Other || I encountered her at a forum in 1 networking event at Sule Shangri-La. Not knowing she is from IGE, just the information that she works for a large conglomerate in Myanmar, I approached her for BD. I later on discovered that she is May Phoo and Chloe's candidate for Corporate secretary for IBTC. 
We then found a spot to have a chat and she shared how busy she is and how important her role is at IGE. She is very grateful for the training she had at the company, but since she was with the company for 6 years now, she perceives there is no more room for career development. She is intrigued that there is an opportunity for her for IBTC. She already made up her mind to leave IGE, thus training someone to take her place since it would take 3 months for her to properly turn over her position to someone else. She said that Vivek told her they are changing management strategies at IBTC and they are thinking of putting her into a different title something like ""strategist.."" not corporate secretary. She is looking forward to the next meeting with them. Right now she is based in Nay Pyi Taw 3-4 times a week and 1-2 days in Yangon. She is willing to take a day's leave when IBTC calls for a meeting.
It was late and she had to prepare for her early flight to Nay Pyi Taw the next day so we had to say goodnight!
Date added: 2016-06-01 || Action: Outbound Call || Company secretary role is closed. They chose Aye Aye Mon but she broke the contract. Now it is happened to contact Su Myat Hla again on 2nd June 2016 after 2 months of last contact. She is in the meeting right now. She will call me back.
Date added: 2016-02-19 || Action: Prescreen || PRESENTATION AND COMMUNICATION: Very well-dressed and good looking. Professional and her English is quite good. It was a good presentation of her background.

AMBITIONS FOR NEXT ROLE: Looking forward to take a director position at IGE.

MOTIVATIONS: Good environment and good people. 

REASON FOR LEAVING: Left Air Bagan - at that time there was crisis of air fare treatment for local and expats. And got sanction around 2007 to fly overseas. 


NOTES: She enjoys her current company. Now 6 years at IGE handling 10 active business units and they also spand  into 12 - 15 business industries.
Working closely with BOD and quite fit for company secretary. She also does corporate affairs but together with Ogilvy. In the future, she is also planning to set up PR department for IGE as well.

She went Australia as intern for 3 months.

At IGE - her earliest position was Executive assistant to Chairman but after probation she was hired as a PR person and work closely with the chairman. Then, all way up to the Head of Executive Office. 

She is half Indian. She has strong local knowledge and network in diverse industry. At IGE, the culture within the company is healthy and non of relatives of the owner get involved in the business.

Date added: 2016-05-05 || Action: Outbound Call || After CCM with Eliott: says Eliott is very inspirational
It is not typical type of job interview. Eliott meniotned about what they do and what he expects the person to replace him to be. She showed about a video of the Marga project. He asked what Thet Aung thinks about the news spreading re Marga. He also mentioned about them wanting to take onboard people who will exhibit loyalty.

Thet Aung seems not very confident he will be the right person to take over Eliott role because he thinks he will still need to learn a lot. Also, he is looking for new opportunities but also is thinking about his loyalty to his current company.

Want to know what Eliott thinks.

Travelling (not very frequent - once a month?)
Room for growth


Notes

Golden sand for Branding and Marketing. I quite like her. Has many career milestones she is proud of. Marketed Diapers - no 1 in the market, Antiseptic - no 2 in the market  and cigarette - AAA, well known. A very good friend of Ko Banyar Dala, Country Manager of Ball corporations. He did marketing for London Cigarette while she was doing AAA. Does contract based consulting jobs; her previous boss - Luc De Waegh from BAT (runs West Indochina) introduce her to corporates and ask to to work hand with him for marketing projects. Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce is approaching her to do market research for Diary products. 

Got headhunted twice; Dupont &amp; Samsung (started using LinkedIn only when she joined Samsung)

Date added: 2016-03-10 || Action: Email || Actively looking for a job in Oil &amp; Gas in Myanmar
""Dear Ms. Mee, 

Following your conversation with Yuko Maskay earlier I am sending you my CV plus academic transcript with this email. 

I am a recent graduate of Clausthal University of Technology, Germany, with a master's degree in Petroleum Engineering - Drilling /Production. I finished my master's studies with a GPA of 3.8 (out of 4) and my bachelor's degree, which was at the same university in Industrial Engineering, with a GPA of 3.2/4.

During my master's studies I was, besides various other activities, leader of a group of eight students in an eight-weeks-project dealing with real field data. Apart from the normal tasks associated with this project, e.g. reservoir modelling, creating an HSE plan and calculating the economics, my duties as group leader were the distribution of the tasks to the respective people, supervising progress, coordinating all efforts and the results, leading group meetings and settling internal discussions. Eventually my group finished best of all teams and I increased not only my professional skills but also learned a lot about group dynamics, being part of a team as well as leading a team. 

Now after my master's studies I am travelling through South East Asia. In summer I will pick up a guaranteed internship at Halliburton Russia which I was awarded as price for winning a competition at the VII Oil and Gas Horizons conference in Moscow, Russia, in November 2015. However, I am currently on the lookout for a job opportunity to contribute to Myanmar's energy industry and become part of the country's development. 

I would therefore appreciate any help you could provide me for this matter. As mentioned earlier, I attached my CV plus academic transcript to this mail and will also add the certificate for the internship at Halliburton. 

Thank you very much and kind regards,
Marc Spinneker"""

Let Kyaw Thu know that it, ""We've received feedback on your profile from e-City. They appreciate your interest and sharing your information and expertise. However, they'll have to give you a miss this time as they need someone who has more experience in retail chain management for this particular role."" 

Date added: 2016-02-29 || Action: Prescreen || Name: Kyaw Thu Aung

Presentation and Communication Skills

Attentive, Assertive and confidant
Not hesitant to give examples if needed on his proposition
Straightforward 
Arrive 10 mins early and confirms the meeting 40 mins before
Professional Traditional Attire


Ambitions for next job move

To involve more on his own business and involve in IT related Sales sector

His GF and younger brother is in charge of operation, he is more on the funding side. MIBF – vocational training schools, course from UK and certified. The first private banking diploma provider in Myanmar.



Reason for Leaving

Need income generating jobs, so took HTC offer
B2G is not exciting as it’s not dynamic for him and also Got offer from HTC and one more
Return to Myanmar to do his own business 


Motivations

AUTONOMY 
Challenges
Money – cash incentives
Working for MNCs/ Big Names 


Notes

I quite like him. Very operational and realistic. Don’t promise the thing he can’t do. Originally planned to join YTU (YIT), but joined computer university instead as he wanted to learn more about business and is interested in Sales. Went to Singapore for studies, and did a course in Marketing, yet move onto Sales only. 
Doesn’t like very corporate culture where he can’t make decision on operations. Can train the staff and bring up sales only if he is given full autonomy. 
He was included in pioneer list bringing in Sumsung to Myanmar. In terms of speciality, only 40% in Marketing in contrast to Richard and Zar Ni. Some of his former colleagues and staff working for e-city, so he knows it is not running well though it's carrying premium brands. HTC dropped e-city from distributor list as he didn't like e-city performance. Staff don't have the mentality of selling Premium value to the customers adding value. 

Current Salary: $3400 USD Gross + Quarterly bonus (3000 usually) + Performance based bonus (received between 3000 &amp; 4000) + Annual fixed bonus – 1 Month Salary 
Expected Salary: $ 5000 USD Gross
Notice Period: Available by end of April (will discuss about it with HTC next week)

Date added: 2016-02-26 || Action: Inbound Call || Can't get through to him in spite of making several calls to all HQs so InMailed him. Gave me a phone call within 5 mins.

Will take career break for 2 months (like end of April). Now delegating/ handing over his works to other colleagues at HTC. Interested in technological related matters. No retail experience."

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Great and Punctual


Ambitions and next job move

To earn more



Reason for leaving

Ooredoo (current company): doesn't keep promise, former HR said they'll give him 3000 USD/ month net (but it's gross and paid in MMK with 1 $ 965 MMK rate)

Mamee Double Decker: Got offer from Ooredoo
The East Asiatic: Cannot raise his salary and he needed more money


Motivators

MONEY 
MONEY &amp; MONEY
Big Names &amp; Company Reputation
Working with Expats (get exposure and knowledge)


Notes

Money is quite important for him as his two sons are now studying higher classes - one in STI university and Grade-10 son in TTC. Big responsibilities is not a problem for him. Trained on Sales by expats while working at The East Asiatic and loves travelling and going out. Realistic .... Proud of working for Dumex and making it market leader in Myanmar (80% of the market). Did marketing and sales from the scratch and knows the ins-and-outs of the business.

If he can change one thing in Ooredoo, it'll be changing distributors. Currently using MDG and big ones yet they don't deliver their promise, use only 7 reps while it's mentioned 10 on the report and not very efficient. In charge of Yangon and Irrawaddy region. Travels a lot on business and support strategy ... doesn't create one. Expats and his manager do it. Managing 65 people - managers and executives.
Very keen in Sales &amp; FMCG - doesn't mind working for beverage firm (he believes they pay more). Tha Phyoe from Carlsberg is his friend and he knows he is earning 6 K.

Praise Designer Distribution, outreach and marketing style in particular packing and bottle color. Will see consistency and QA.


Current Salary: $ 5000 USD Gross paid in MMK with the market rate starting from April 2016 ( before it was $ 3000 USD gross - paid in MMK 1 $ - 965 MMMK rate) + Car with a driver + Health Insurance + Company bonus - 2 months salary (pay in April) + Performance based bonus (1,400,000 - 1,500,000 MMK/ month depend on hitting the reasonable target)
Expected Salary: $ 7000 USD Gross without any benefits or  Negotiable if a Car with a driver provided

Presentation and Communications Skills

Bubbly, yet informative
Very Good Burmese and polite

Will definitely reach her for mid-level position or country rep for Insurance in Myanmar. 


Ambitions for Next Job Move

To contribute her skills to her own Myanmar and grow at the same time


Reasons for leaving

Sime Darby: got offer from Aon


Motivations

Autonomy 
Career Development
Paying Forward
Dynamics environment
Working with SMART people 

Note

Knows quite well about Life Insurance and Employee Benefits. Very keen to go into Product Development and Business Development in Insurance sector and explore new adventure. Not much experience in General insurance, but willing to try. Current company doesn’t offer her that opportunity, as it’s very corporate. Repetitive job nature doesn’t fit her - relationship management and handling routine complaints . Enjoys meeting people. Took Insurance as her career. Didn’t plan to take it as a career until she was well-trained by Sime Darby and got a sense what Insurance is. Got to know Aon through her former colleague and got offer after interview. 
Will visit Yangon in April, and has plan to permanently return later this year as soon as she found the right job. Her family is in Yangon.

Current Salary: 3700 SGD Gross + Insurance + Team Portfolio profit 
Notice Period: 2 Months

He has done agreement with Isuzu and Volvo Luxury car (Show room to be open in April 2016). Also, he has to do feasible study, due diligence and business proposals, EOI, tenders and so on. He likes the format and procedure, which is perfectly formed  by foreign experts. Also they do monthly KPI. However, he doesn't like because it is family type culture and only boss and his wife are decision makers. They have very high turnover rate because the pay is really low and Chairman doesn't accept advise on the pay roll. Also, do not accept advise on other matter - for e.g. Yangon Waterboom is not successful because it is opened before it is ready.

Date added: 2016-04-02 || Action: Prescreen || smart and very good English. Punctual and patient
She was already contacted by the HR of UOB the week before and she met Harry Loh.
She is very interested in Financial Institutions or any roles related to Trade Finance, but not into banking this time.
That is because she had experience with KBZ and the process is too slow and the bulk of projects are so low that it is too boring for her. Also, she just got promoted the day before so she might wait a little bit before moving.

She is more interested to work with international companies that gives her much challenge. Culture is not an issue for her because she successfully adjusted well with CDSG so she is confident she can adapt to new ones.

She does not want to disclose her current salary package, but gave a range which is 25-30 lakhs plus ferry and phone top up allowance.
Her expected salary would be from 30-35 lakhs and her notice period is 2 months.
Date added: 2016-04-01 || Action: Outbound Call || she is interested but very busy this days. wants to meet after water festival if it is not urgent. in the end, agreed to meet over the weekend, but asked that it would just be a casual meeting not be an interview.

Date added: 2016-08-09 || Action: Prescreen || David asked if we can HH him from takasago.
Lewis has worked with David before at DKSH for 3 years and he liked working with him.
He is the perfect candidate for personal care, however, he does not want to move to Behn Meyer. He has worked in other companies on personal care so he does not want to go forward for the same position at behn meyer because then he would be selling the same product  and believes it would destroy customer's trust on him and will affect bm as well.
Also, he wants to work more on the client side now. 
he was offered an operations manager position at jj pun but he did not accept.
Date added: 2016-08-09 || Action: Outbound Call || He is ok to meet for NO
Date added: 2016-05-16 || Action: Prescreen || PRESENTATION AND COMMUNICATION: Pleasant personality and good looking. Well suited and nice speaker. Very nice guy - probably gay

AMBITIONS FOR NEXT ROLE: 
Senior Management 

MOTIVATIONS: 
Company Image (Easy to grab customer and marketing introducing)
Initiating a new company/ project
- Prefer Production company (principle) rather than distribution side

REASON FOR LEAVING: Quit U Kyu - Have to stay in factory and the company would like to take NRC of the staff and control everything

Quit M.Y - Get offer by DKSH and monney
Quit DKSH - chemical was new department at that time. Company's supply chain system was crappy for chemical products and got a lot of complains.

Quit JJ Pun - Responsible for food &amp; animal feed. Hard to convince customer as he is not a vet. Doesn't like visit to farm and feel bad for animals

Quit DKSH - He joined DKSH again because of his Country Head (David MacDonald). 
David was forced to resigned by DKSH as he signed a contract written in Thai Language.  So, he also pissed off on that fact that DKSH won't cover for staffs but only for their image. 
Regulatory is very serious (Code of conduct) and not secure for staffs
Also he wants to try Principle side.
 
NOTES:
Got lots of info about chemical industry
Jeff More was the one started DKSH in Myanmar.

He doesn't want to change competitor company especially fragrance and flavour because he doesn't want customer to mess up by changing companies and selling the same thing - which will also affect the company image

Very good relationship with customers (got 3 recommendations when he changed to a new job)

Trust built strong with his customers

Only quit when his companies and projects settled.

Took 3 months to quit

Things he doesn't like about Takasago-
HR troubled him after job offer (salary, JD and others)
Didn't mention him that they would ask recommendations to his customers
- Entrepreneur Award of DKSH (together with Vietnam team as in Myanmar they don't have lab and facility)
   - Lab exp for shampoo
   - Plan strategy for suppliers 
   - Shampoo - saturated market

Report to SG office (only 3 ppl in Yangon office now)

CURRENT: 1800 USD Net per month + Quarterly Commision + Yearly Bonus (His salary will be raised in May - after probation)
EXPECTED: Above 2,000 USD
NOTICE: 1 month

still working for the same company


Motivators

Money (needs to support her parents)
Room for growth
Big Names

Notes

I quite like her. Willing to learn and so positive and young. Has a sense of humor. Been sent to Malay, Vietnam and Bangkok for product training with her manager for home and personal care products. For animal nutrition, she does oversea travel alone and directly reports to GM - Zaw Moe Aung. Knows she is highly underpaid, but sticking  with current company as there is office hour flexibility and free Chinese class in the morning. Said to be the only one in the market who holds chemical engineering degree and does take care of the whole animal nutrition business for the company. Speaks very good Chinese and fair English. Does pricing, supplier management, product selection, market survey and vising to feed mills in Taunggyi and Mandalay alone. The only time she needs coordination from the GM is signing the contract. She believes Myanmar market is a bit small for animal nutrition, but is positive it'll eventually become bigger. 

If she has a choice, doesn't want to go into different industry as she doesn't want to face the same client and customers again - feeling ARNAR!!!!

Date added: 2016-09-01 || Action: Outbound Call || After CCM: Met with Cavan and had casual conversation.
Concerns:
-He offered him assistant brand manager position. He is currently a Senior Brand Manager so he can not take that.
-Cavan said his expected salary is high. They can  only offer $2100 including everything. He is now on $2,500 net and not including all other benefits. His expected one is $3000 + standard benefits.

Because of these, he is not going to go forward. 
I will speak with Thi Thi though to know Cavan's feedback since I do not have Cavan's phone number.

Date added: 2016-08-31 || Action: Interview Scheduled ||  
Date added: 2016-08-31 || Action: Outbound Call || Spoke to him about interview with Cavan of IBTC on Friday. Unfortunately, he is going to Mawlayan from Friday-Monday for business trip.
Advised cavan about it and waiting for reply.

There is a mismatch with the dates written on linkedin and the dates on his CV. 
I called to clarify and he said the ones on the CV he sent is the correct one.
He gave me permission to add his current  job to his CV, but would need his current JD. He asked to be given a little more time and will send me a reply after lunch since he is with his boss.
Date added: 2016-08-30 || Action: Outbound Call || Called to follow up again on his CV. He canceled the call.
Sent him SMS.
Date added: 2016-08-29 || Action: Outbound Call || Called to ask his updated CV. He said he will send it surely tonight. He is travelling to Mandalay to do marketing but will do his best.
Date added: 2016-08-25 || Action: Outbound Call || Called earlier to get his decision for IBTC and his CV as well. he said he is very busy and will do it late.

Called again to get his decision and he said it is okay to put him forwards.
Date added: 2016-08-24 || Action: Prescreen || Met him for IBTC Brand Manager at Gloria Jeans.

He is a good fit for the job. He needs to think about it though.

Concerns:
When he was working for the company years ago, there was a problem with HR and he has friends still working there who are still in low positions. Explained everything is changing.
He wants to change products or industry. He has been in alcohol for a long time, that is why he accepted the job at his current company.
Will let me know of his decision after some thinking.
HE sent message though afterwards saying the interview was exciting!

Date added: 2016-06-21 || Action: Inbound Call || After CCM: He called me through Skype in the evening and told me about the conversation he had with Alex and Antony.

Alex is a technical person so asking him a lot of technicalities for his current and past projects and his core strengths and how it will connect with the projects Marga is having now. Mark explained to them his executions and solutions..
Alex also asked how many people under him: he has 15 leads/heads of departments under him including quality (which is the main), construction, engineering, commercial, contractual, QS, etc. The workers are from Malaysia and Bangladesh.

Antony (whom he said is Black American (this one I am not sure, but I agreed) asked him about: his expectations, graft and corruption and mentioned about profit sharing (which is 10-12x monthly salary) which is an incentive they will be giving.
*graft and corruption: he explained that in Malaysia, sub-contractors offer something and he experience this on a daily basis. He said they would offer something and promise to accomplish works which at the end of the day is bad work. He explained that McConnell Dowell has Mitigation and Elimination process for this kind of problems. Antony explained that they have a different way to curve this which is profit sharing.
Mark said this is something he never had before. In his company now, they don't really give any bonuses. The highest bonus he ever had from work was x3 of his monthly salary.

He said his motto is: ""Come what may."" He will work with whatever project he is on as much as he can. Acc to him, born as a Capricorn, he is a perfectionist which has an advantage and disadvantage. But he learned from his project in Malaysia that this does not work. In his experience, he did not sleep for 4 days checking on everything so that it will go well when execution starts, and in the end it did not. So he learned to be more flexible.

He has a little doubt about the structure of Marga. He is a bit concerned how they all work together in the company and if their project will go well. I assured him, Marga made up their mind to stay here and see their projects through until completion. If not, they would have run away when their first one was cancelled. 
He also asked if the role is a replacement. Although I am not sure, I said I believe it is not as the project they are going to do is a new one.

As opposed to what he mentioned during our first conversation, his project now will be completed at teh end of August not September, but he said it is ok since he would need time to have vacation first.

He asked that if the result is negative, I will list down all the reasons for his own development.

Date added: 2016-06-10 || Action: Outbound Call || Looking forward for jobs in Singapore since he holds a Singaporean citizenship, but would be considering Myanmar if the package is right. 
After explaining Myanmar is fast developing and introducing Marga, he became interested.

also, his wife is 4 months pregnant and will be delivering in the Philippines to be with family.

Perfect English - Professional, good looking and good at presenting her profile

Wore traditional attire for the interview

AMBITIONS FOR NEXT ROLE: 
Challenging position

MOTIVATIONS: 
International companies

Challenge
- Government Relations
- Dealing with other companies

Good colleagues

REASON FOR LEAVING:
Left Summit Park View - to be a flight attendant

Left Golden Hill - Didn't happen to be Flight Attendant and joined Golden Hill
Quit to go to university 

Left JICA - Tired of working hours and overloading
got offer from Petronas (TEAM) which is really good pay 

Left TEAM - Get married and her husband worked in SG at that time so moved to SG with her husband

Left - EMAS  - Her boss moved to Connect and brought her there

Left Connect - Merged with other company and she is not happy
Got offer from Pacific with very good package

Left Pacific - To go back Myanmar

Left Technip - She is the only one staff for the Myanmar company and running all by herself
She asked for one more staff to help her but the company didn't agree her

Left global fund - Just to help temporary (The gap before the replacement)
Boss is her referee

Left John Hancock - John sold assets of his company to his client (PanAust) and asked his staffs to join PanAust

John (~70 yrs old) is now the most senior person of Baker and Mackenzie.

NOTES:
She is perfect for Highland.
Well versed with 
- Government Relations
- Administration
- HR
- Finance (LCCI Diploma - level 3)

Very good personality

At PanAust,
Liaise with Ministries - Mine (Natural Resource...) and other related ministries
Site is at Sagaing 
Travel Sagaing and Laos
Very good relationship with the colleagues - so it will be hard to quit
Since at John Hancock - she worked for PanAust mainly (there were only 3 clients at John)
So it can be said it has been 2 years working for PanAust.

- She got 1000 USD at John as she joined there to learn new things and her job wasn't overloaded. So she deduct her salary expectation. She earned a lot more while working for Oil &amp; Gas.

A good candidate for Parami, CA position.

She is happy to where she works now.
In the long run, she wants to switch off.

She is sort of more interested in the donor agency sector, like wants to move NGO.

After introduced about Parami, she accepted to share her profile with them and said okay to work in the oil and gas industry as currently she is also handling many oil &amp; gas clients. Her strength is to develop an accounting system with implementing the whole system.

Dear May Phoo Kywe &amp; Ngwar Bo Mee,

I trust this email finds you well.

I met both of you at the British chamber networking event a few months ago.

Some background, my contract has come to an end and I'm seeking new opportunities for employment in Myanmar.

I'm keen to change my career away from a tourism focus, and I would like to submit my profile to Aquila Executive Search and explore any potential? 

I believe that my experience and business acumen may be transferable for business development and general management roles across sectors.

I have gathered first-hand knowledge and experience operating in country, all of which, may support a variety of industry interests. 

Please find CV attached for your kind review. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Christian Parkinson"

said she gave him a choice: to join or not; think about it and decide within a month and they can meet again.
now, situation is difficult for him to decide because it will change the nature of his job so he has to talk also to his family.
work nature: various areas of law: commercial, not focused on only 1. He like it but it will be a big change for him.

said Lucy is kind. She is looking for someone to work for her for a long time. She is willing to train him for 1-2 years and see if he can follow or not.

now he has unfinished works to do and Lucy understands and is willing to wait for his decision in a month.

Date added: 2016-06-28 || Action: Outbound Call || He said he wants to drop meeting Lucy Wayne because he is looking forward to being sent overseas by his company in 3 months for a trip. He also is not very interested going into law firm.

I was able convince him to go meet Lucy anyway and then make decision afterward. I told him LWA is a big firm with international lawyers and with clients from diverse industries so he will not be tied up with a single area of work. That is one reason he gave during my meeting with him. He was trying to say that law firm is monotonous and the benefits are not as good as being a corporate lawyer.

Anyway, in the end he agreed to set up a meeting with Lucy after office hours.
Date added: 2016-06-20 || Action: Outbound Call || Interested to meet Lucy, but very busy and on business trip to Nay Pi Taw this week. Not sure about next week because he might go travelling.
Lucy said she is really keen in meeting him before she leaves yangon for a month on the 1st of July.

H Chloe,

 

Please find attached an offer letter for Cathy. According to Bill, he had already discussed numbers with Cathy, so my room for manoeuvre is a bit limited. What I can say is that unlike Digicel we are a start-up and we have tried to keep costs down until we begin generating revenue, this cost focus has included salary costs.

 

We will be reviewing salaries, bonuses and benefits before year end with a view to bringing them more into line with current market levels. We feel that this will be a great place for Cathy to build her career and we are all excited for her to join.

 

Happy to discuss

He is neat and well dressed and has excellent English and good sales voice. He is quite upbeat.
He is more on operations and doing a little in sales as he is supporting all staff in the company. He is knowledgeable on chemicals though and would learn easily.
He studied his bachelors in Singapore while working part time organizing events. Got back to Myanmar and got the job right away at Academy chemical. His friend told him about the opening and he applied. He has been with the company for 2 years now and is working on making the company big and international. He has the vision of distributing their products outside Myanmar.
He finished his MBA and is waiting for his graduation next year.

I apologise for being delay to forward my resume to you.

Please find my updated resume for your kind attention. Let me know should you require any further information and also let me have the updated status. 

Fyi, my current salary is 2,000,000 Myanmar kyats. However, I did earn significantly during my employment at the firms, i.e. I earned 2,500 USD per month at WongPartnership Myanmar Limited (Singapore firm) and 2,000 USD at Nishumura Asahi (Jap firm), which is why my expectation would be between 2,300 - 2,500 USD.  

Thank you for your time.

Date added: 2016-06-24 || Action: Prescreen || 6 + years of extensive international Procurement and logistics experience in Singapore

Currently, working as a procurement manager at Myanmar MaharHtun Co., (From 2014)
Reason for leaving from current company is that she has to deal with government ministries. In which, they assigned her tasks with no prior planning. At current company, there are four people under her management. 

She will be happy to work with prior planning tasks.

Current salary : 1,200,000 kyats plus phone, transportation allowances
Expected Salary : 1,800,000 kyats (negotiable)

She is more interested in the machinery firm and Contractor.
Chemical firm will be the last priority choosing to work for.

For FMCG, she agrees to share her CV to the clients but she has less confident because she doesn't have FMCG background experience. If she is allowed trainings, she is willing to work.

Graduated with Computer Science in Yangon.
Full knowledge of ISO internal auditor.

She also wants to work at Thilawa SEZ japanese industries.
Notice Period : 2 Months


Jolyn and I had a meeting with her at Aquila for TPG, Senior Procurement role. We did not introduce her about TPG because we think she is not the right fit for TPG.

24/June/2016





Date added: 2016-06-24 || Action: Prescreen || Good for procurement, but not for IBTC.

She is sweet and her English is very good and can express herself very well.
About for years experience in Singapore -- first doing documentation and logistics, at a Food trading company. The company closed down because of the ild problem in China -- their raw materials for their milk product are from China. Then she moved to steels and other industry raw materials trading company where she found her passion. She came back to Myanmar because of new opportunities and to be with her mother. She wanted to start her own business but needed entrepreneur knowledge and capital so she worked for a local trading company as an asst procurement manager. After few months, she got promoted and got everyone have ISO certification.

Although she is happy with her job and her colleagues, she does not like the connections with the military. Tehy are unpredictable, calling anytime to ask for something to be done rush and takes a while for the next action. She wants more structured and more programmed work hence she wants to move to an MNC. She already applied to some companies including a Japanese company at Thilawa ZED and awaiting their call. She was contacted by s Singapore-based company but the job scope does not match her skills. She was also contacted by an MnE from Cambodia.

Date added: 2016-07-27 || Action: Prescreen ||  Met Jonathan with Du Sar Mee for Off Trade Marketing for IBTC.

He has excellent English, dressed well neat, handsome and very confident.
He just resigned from Coca-cola where he has been working for 2 years as channel manager. He resigned because his works are not part of his job description. It is challenging for him which he likes, but he wants to focus and enhance his skills in one department not every department in marketing. He expressed his thoughts to the management and ask if they could make him a different title not channel marketing because in actuality he is doing a lot more. They are not doing anything about it so he contacted Mango.
Mango offered him a position as an account manager and he will start in Mid-August.
He likes his position in Mnago because he really wants to do  digital marketing and that he will be involved with different products not only one. 
CS with coca-coal is US$1,500 plus car, phone expenses, health insurance and other standard benefits.
ES is US$3,000
Mango offered him US$1,800, but after his probation, they will give him his expected one but not as a salary but will come in other ways.
Mango normally has 6-mo probation, but he asked for 3 and they accepted.

He is still open to other opportunities.
Discussed about Marga's BD and he is very interested.
Date added: 2016-07-27 || Action: Prescreen || Good candidate.

Thank you for your patience, I have already reviewed the JD and although this is a great opportunity and I feel that I can deliver, however at this juncture I do not feel I can fully move permanently overseas.

Came back to Malay and worked in Agricultural sector.
Got connection to set up a rental business - like shortcut, wasn't successful, but learned to become from employee and employer 
Went into banking to have understanding on how business operates and the procedure. Visited to many countries - Hong Kong and Thailand to explore business opportunities and ideas and found Storage Business is the best one to run in Malaysia. Has a partner (didn't hear well) in Thailand. 

Always wanted to run own business, rather to be given instruction. Even at OCBC, clients and colleagues told him he is much more like a businessman rather than a banker. 

Sounds interested in Dignitas. Punchy question, precise and short answers - asked 
- why don't we recruit local for this role to have better communication with the staff.
- if Aquila is the same as Accenture.


Will carry on from email. 
Line got cut off 3 times during the phone call. "

Date added: 2016-08-18 || Action: Prescreen || Met him for a chat at the Internations event in Luxury Yacht Hotel.
He has very strong marketing background and open to any opportunities as long as it is a role in line with his expertise and similar to his current role.

He accepted the offer from Sail while he was still in Pakistan (then he had another offer in Africa) because he pretty much have done everything in Pakistan and so became stagnant in his position that time. The only way for him to grow and do more is to work abroad or start his own business. He though it was not right to do his own business then so he opted for working abroad. He chose the job for Sail in Myanmar because it is an emerging country and it is a very good opportunity for him and chose sail because it is a good chance to showcase his skills and it is a company similar to what he has been working at. There was another offer for him that time in Myanmar from an investor to start a business but he did not take it because he does not know the market yet.

Now he wants to leave Sail because of the management. They are not following what was in the contract. He is doing PR when he signed a media marketing one. He did not have any experience in PR. He took it anyway because he was new and wants to impress them so was doing many roles at the same time without being compensated more.
They eventually hired someone for media which is what he wanted to do. 
They promised to pay for his visa but are not doing it. The Management do not really care because they know from previous experience that it is hard for a foreigner to go back to his/her country after a while to get a job that is whya they think foreign employees will stay anyway. These and that the company (he thinks) will go down pretty soon are the reasons why he wants to look for another job.
He wants to stay longer in Myanmar or other countries, if tehre are opportunities, because he can not go abck hooem just yet. 

He has been looking for a month now and he has contacted other agencies but no reply yet. 

He is here with his wife, no kids.
He is on $4,500 net. He is happy to accept a salary slightly lower.
Date added: 2016-08-16 || Action: Other || Dear Chloe,

Hope you are well.

I am a communications and media strategy professional with substantial experience in the industry. Attaching here my CV for more information and background.

I am in Myanmar and actively looking for a job in marketing and communication functions as my current company is not doing well and maybe they shut it down.

Please let me know if you/Aquila can help to get me a new job.

Been to several countries as a tour guide, and a short trip to Myanmar and 6 months to China for BD. Found her passion at her first job in Travel &amp; Tour Industry and then moved into Financial Institution for about 5 years - corporate finance sales - loan and mortgages. Very good client relationship. She can still bring her clients from former companies as new clients to a new company. I quite like her. 


Financial sales (5 yrs): market was a bit slow, government reinforce SME and found IT fascinating

Yesterday I provided you with rough figures in USD about my former salary with Lombard Odier Investment Managers.

Please find below more accurate ones (with an exchange rate as of today, source: XE Currency, 1 CHF = 1.0202 USD). 

My salary (paid out 12 times per year) was based on an employment rate of 100% (no part time) and on 40 hours per week (and 25 days of vacation):

- Gross monthly salary: CHF 12'500 -&gt; USD 12'752
- Net monthly salary: CHF 10'830 - &gt; USD 11'048

Here are the costs deduced from the gross salary to get the net salary:

- mandatory national retirement contribution, 
- occupational pension scheme's contribution, 
- mandatory national unemployment insurance. 

Hope that helps a bit more.

Until September 2015 I was an associate in Eversheds'? corporate and commercial group, with a particular focus on the clean energy sector. I was based in Eversheds' office in Amman, Jordan from September 2014 until September 2015.

Until September 2015 I was an associate in Eversheds'? corporate and commercial group, with a particular focus on the clean energy sector. I was based in Eversheds' office in Amman, Jordan from September 2014 until September 2015. 

I have acted on a wide range of transactions in the UK and internationally and across all renewables technologies. These include M&A transactions, corporate reorganisations, joint ventures, equity and debt fundraisings. Whilst in Jordan my work also involved me providing general commercial advice, advice on project finance and real estate matters, as well as assisting with local law elements of transactions. 

I have experience of drafting and negotiating various corporate and commercial documents including Share Purchase Agreements, Asset Transfer Agreements, Shareholder/Joint Venture Agreements, Power Purchase Agreements, security documents, general commercial agreements and other ancillary transaction documentation. I am also experienced at carrying out both buyer and vendor due diligence and project managing the production of the relevant due diligence reports.

The clients I have represented include UK and foreign owned utilities, private equity and infrastructure funds, developers, EPC contractors and banks.","Bullhorn Candidate ID: 2658

Date added: 2016-08-19 || Action: Prescreen || •	Not the caliber of candidate we should be introducing to our clients.
•	Work on reducing attrition rate: job analysis of all roles, restructure the organisation based on findings of job analysis, revising roles and reducing manpower
•	Setting up of employment contracts. Liaisons with labour officials to ensure contracts are compliant and also with the tax office
•	Coach exiting managers to be real managers.
•	Resolving issues between employees and also employees and management. 
•	Wants to work for MNC and international companies
•	Left shop.com as it was a small business. Management was stingy. Issues with the management as was not able to align between country manager and employee
•	A bit jumpy – 8 jobs in six years (2010 – 2016)
•	At shop.com – designed organisation structure and carried out workforce planning. Used LinkedIn and personal network to hire staff. Designed orientation, performance management, employee welfare, training and development. Internet based training, power point. Feedback form, analysis and report to trainer. Discussions with management to identify training needs… No links to performance management.
•	ER experience – termination of employees due to no budget. Liaising with labour office for terminations. Terminate poor people immediately and improvement plan put in place. No extensive experience of dealing with disciplinary, grievance or unions
•	Developed succession plan – to identify who will be potential leaders
•	Employee engagement and motivation – parties and social events
•	More of a generalist than a specialist in a particular HR function.
•	Experience of salary banding and allocating new hires to relevant bands, administration of bonuses, salary reviews.
•	Not very good at receiving feedback and can get a bit argumentative and defensive.

Date added: 2016-11-01 || Action: Outbound Call || York is travelling at the moment and back in Yangon mid Nov and will follow up with him on CFLD then. They are keen to have an initial chat with him.
Date added: 2016-10-13 || Action: Prescreen || Met with York to explore potential for the President/CEO role at CFLD. He is not actively looking for a role. He has been with Keppel land for 22 years and is very happy there. He would only consider a role that has a remit for a wider geographical area than Myanmar, and it should cover more than one SE Asian regions. Originally from Singapore, his family still live there. He has a good understanding and knowledge of the Myanmar real estate and property development sectors, which he developed from when he moved here with Keppel 3 years ago... Will check with CFLD on the potential for a wider remit before introducing the role to him. He has apparently been contacted by two other agencies based in Singapore for a similar role; but I'm the only one he has met with. One of the agencies said it's a Chinese company. While I didn't mention CFLD to him, he did say the likelihood of moving to a Chinese company would be low for him... I'm still going to try and turn that around.

Can't negotiate on notice period - 2 months as she has other consulting projects that will finish in mid of November and she is not over the moon to work for other companies as she is running her own firm. But interested in Deloitte. Doesn't think Deloitte can offer her expected salary - 3500 USD as the work she'll be doing there is narrower she thinks.

Thanks for the follow up – indeed I had a good chat with Myo Thetwe and came away very impressed with her 16 years in Charles Schwab evaluating alternative investments, such as PE funds, derivatives, real estate, for CS clients.  The missing link, though, was in direct PE transaction experience – without which it is difficult for us to consider her for a role as a Senior Analyst.  At the same time, I feel that it would be a severe waste of her extensive sell-side experience to come on board as a junior Analyst.  I indicated as much to her, and we both agreed.  I have no doubt that there will be other eminently suitable roles for her in the fledgling financial sector, but for now, it is unlikely that there will be a suitable role at MIL.  We will certainly get back to you if something should come up in the near future.  But please do convey my very best wishes to her – I do believe the country needs talents like her to return and contribute to the development of the country.

He is too senior and too expensive.
Very interested to get another job in Myanmar, but will not accept a salary lesser than $8,000 because then he will just move back to his old company in the Phils (RCBC). He already talked to his old boss and tehy are willing to take him back.
Looking forward to meeting with a senior person from JCB on the 1st of October to work on a project. If he gets the job, he can work either in Myanmar or the Philippines.

Refer to his CV and Bo Mee's notes for more info.
Will be meeting him for some events this coming weeks to meet some high ranking filipinos in companies here in Myanmar.  He is a very good reference person.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Positive
Direct 
Presentable, Punctual, Respectful

Ambitions and next job move

Join a company in Myanmar that encourages or practice international standards or at least open to raise their working standards 


Reason for leaving

UAB: company terminated his contract without providing any reason (Petpeeves he has there - didn't give him on-boarding when he first joined, Meeting minutes are altered - they wrote in Burmese &amp; he can't read)
RCBC: UAB headhunted him through a search firm and took 1 year to get him on board


Motivators

Autonomy
Deliverable - KPIs for 100 days
Working Environment
Compensation (Better housing than UAB - UAB gave him crappy housing - has to fill in water tank manually and not convenient for stay at all, so spent his own money to stay in hotel closeby during weekends)



Notes

Positive about Myanmar economic development and love to be in the country. Very good with Banking products development and alternative solutions/ channels, Credit and mobile banking. Result-focus person. Initiated and completed BRD 1 for UAB (product development). 

The most preferrably company he's worked so far - Citi - Learnt a lot from there structure wise and operation wise. Well structured, international standard, lady boss. Led a big team there. 


Met with 
KBZ - Ko Ye last week of August, KBZ Gateway CEO like early August??
YOMA - Andrew in 3rd week of August, haven't met Hel 
AYA - U Mun Sun (Malay Expat) and U Myo 
Myanmar ... (forgot name) Bank - the MD on 2 August through

Date added: 2016-09-30 || Action: Prescreen || Met him with du sar me.

He could be a good fit for viber; however, he is not really ready and interested moving to a new company. He has been contacted by headhunters and has been pushed by a lady from another executive search for a job for true money. He did not meet them.
He considered to meet us because we did not push too much. DSM has been flexible with the time and he considered meeting for a connection for future opportunities for him or for his company's benefit.
His contract will not end very soon and it is with the headquarters in Oslo so after the projects here, he has a choice to move to Bangkok or Oslo. Or if there are no open positions, he has the benefit of going back to his country and be paid for a year even without a job. It follows with any other telecom senior guys who stays with the company for a long time.
He has just been given the project to start wave money along with 2 other guys also from telenor. It is a joint operations of telenor and yoma bank. It was launched 2 months ago and he wants to see it really work before leaving. He might start looking by December and it all depends on what will happen in April if he will stay here or other countries. This is because of the education of his daughter. She will go to 8th grade and he thinks she will not get the right education here. 
They have properties in Singapore so most likely his daughter will get educated in Singapore in the future. For her to prepare for that, she needs to go back to India. 
For him, even if he does not get a position in India, he is interested in trying out Vietnam and the Philippines. If it happens, his family will stay back n India.

He said he would be expensive for any companies here, esp in his area or expertise. He is being paid about 10k without tax per month plus other benefits which are a lot bigger: housing which could amount to up to 6k a month, nice car, education for his daughter, medical insurance for the whole family, 2 way ticket for the whole family to India 2 times a year, return ticket to home country after contract for the whole family.
He asked the company if he could manage his own housing and get cash instead but it is Against the policy of the company.
He said he is not very motivated though with the salary because he has enough and he has already some properties in Singapore. It is more of the nature and challenge of the job. He has done start ups so it is something he is very good at and is willing to do.

Discussed to him about viber and he said it is a very good company and the role is interesting but because of his dedication to his project and his loyalty to his boss, he can not take it. However, he said he will refer other friends and would need at least 2 days to send referrals.
Also he needs more information about the role for him to refer the right person. DSM will send it.
He will be sending also his CV to DSM for future reference including a breakdown of his salary package.

Date added: 2016-06-02 || Action: Appointment || Meeting notes (Tin Myint Zaw, CA, Puma Energy) @Peperoni Pizza, 5:45P.M

Currently, he is working for Puma Energy.
He is willing to work for the oil and gas industry than others. 

Reason for leaving is that they don't give him the remuneration packages as negotiated! So money is his motivation. His current salary is USD 4,000 but he receives by Kyats only. He feels depressed for that as well. Expected salary is negotiable depending on job scope.

Another reason for he wants to move is that he feels like his manager is always trying to against him. 

So he seems like he already decided to resign from this organization because he says that it doesn't matter for him if he can not get the job offer as he expected because he can work as a consultant for his friend's agency anytime. 

The only he concerns about is that illegal work assigned by the company. Others, he has no worries. And, for the accounting management can be assumed highly responsible. "

She has been doing it in Daewoo for the past 2 years. She was with the company for 6 years on 3 different roles: document controller, then Assistant HR. Although she performed the functions of an L&amp;D after the consultant left 2 years ago, she was not given that title. Her title as Assistant was retained.

As of the moment, she does not fit any HR roles we have. But she could be good for future ones.

I'm really interested to join your organization but as I explained to you on that day, I can only come back to Myanmar after April 2017.
Please kindly let me know if you still have a vacancy at that time and keep in touch.
I attached herewith my CV for your review and attention.
Thank you very much.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Honest and ethical
Straightforward and committed
36 year old, knowledgeable
Arrived 15 mins before
Smiling throughout the interview (sometimes I even feel uncomfortable)


Ambitions and next job move



Reason for leaving

Qingjian: to renew PR in Sg (resigned, last day today - company took it as Paid without leave, asked him to come work for them upon his return)

Sin Loon Lee (Developer) : enjoyed working there, returned to Myanmar as he thought country has changed in a positive direction, his wife is in Myanmar too
Soilbuild: difficult for him to do audit for the government as the boss is not just a developer also a contractor for projects
Surbana: project was very small (only lift), not challenging 
High Tech: left to Singapore for Master studies

Projects he recently worked on - Sule Squre Centre, Ocean Shwe Gone Taing, Huawei office - 3 floors in Myanmar Plaza, Victoria Secret Underwear Manufacturing (finished projects within 8 months).

Team size for each project - between 20 &amp; 40 depend on project size.

Motivators

MNCs
Job Scope(busy is better)
Company Image (no corruption)
Starts-up or well-established both fine

Notes

I like him - Burmese Chinese ... Passionate about Engineering. Prefer Developer than Contractor. Help High Tech and Qingjian with ISO. Lead Tender projects, meets minister, project management, getting approval from different government approval. 
A bit discouraged with YCDC - doesn't show up at the appointed time for inspection matters causing projects delay, the obvious one is Sule Square Centre .... Construction was done since a long time ago. 

Got offer from CDSG when he returns Myanmar, but he had already taken offer from Qingjian. 

Reports to AGM - Australian
His wife and he, both are engineers. 

Enjoyed working at 
Sin Loon Lee, small company - 20-30 people, has autonomy
Qingjjian - used to have 120, due to government regulation, about 80 left - 20 made redundant - the rest left on their own as the market wasn't stable. Company even have to take renovation projects. 


CS: 7800 SGD Gross + 600,00 MMK for Transportation Allowance + Life &amp; Health Insurance + Annual Bonus (performance based) - recevied 2 months in 2015 + Project based bonus

ES: a match to current salary, but Net (Tax in Myanmar is high)
NP:

He is going back this month to Sg to renew PR (march) as he has to stay there 6 months before renewal. If thing doesn't go well, he will sell the house and return Myanmar anytime. 
Property market is busted in Sg, so a bit hesitant to sell his second house there. 
Wife is in Yangon.

Date added: 2016-09-23 || Action: Prescreen || a very driven candidate

8 yrs working experience in SG

He's already resigned from CNQC as he has to go SG for extension or renewal of Singapore Permanent Resident in March. After that, he will come back in MM. 

Age:36 (Married with no kids)

CS: 7800 SGD plus 6.5 lakhs for car allowance and life insurance, last year he got bonus for 2 months salary, 


ES: negotiable with (Net)

First job at High Tech Concrete. The reason for leaving is to go for MBA to SG.

After MBA, he got a job in SG as Resident Engineer at Surbana. The reason for leaving is to have experience with big projects. 

After that he joined at Soilbuild with two years contract.

His fav job is at Sin soon lee development where he enjoyed the most working.

Arrived 15 mins before the meeting
Knows his strength quite well
AMBITIONS FOR NEXT ROLE:

MOTIVATIONS:

Company Reputation 
Autonomy 
Well structure organization or organization that allows him to create a good structure 


REASON FOR LEAVING:

Surbana SG: requested him to help out with Surbana Myanmar
Polygon: Owner doesn't want to build a proper company structure though he wants to get better grade from B2 to A1
Great Earth: Got direct offer from Polygon
Yuzana: went to Sg for studies (but didn't do it as he was busy with his work - compared working and studying, found working more suitable in terms of finance)

NOTES:

Proudest project
Sembawang Shopping Center - 
had to create man made river - started from the very scratch. Was a jungle - within 2 years - became urban area. Were 4 Burmese national, 1 Manager, 1 Site Engineer and .. surveyors  Said there are 22 project managers, assistant PM and Directors of PM in Surbana Myanmar Project Management Team. He is responsible for Mix development project - project management. Has extensive experience in evaluating the proposals and advising senior people for contractors selection. 

I like him. Very soft spoken ... that makes him look like not confident enough. Planned to work in Sg until 2019 and to return Myanmar to start his own business or work at management level, but had to come back earlier as Sabarna Myanmar requested him to and has got an 8 months old daughter in Myanmar. Wife has her own business - she returned from SG in 2015 - live in North Dagon. Worked for Government projects mostly both from owner site and contractor side. 

Found his passion at Grade-10, later found himself that he is more keen on construction management than pure engineering, Design creation and so forth so pull himself closer to it. Result-oriented person and quite honest. 

CURRENT: 2400 USD Gross + Petrol Allowance (had to take low salary below 1500 USD what he was receiving in Surbana Sg, didn't know he had to pay his own tax)
EXPECTED: Negotiable (preferably 3500 USD)

Date added: 2016-12-27 || Action: Email || Hi Jolyn,
My project with Ooredoo Myanmar has ended. I would like to explore options in telecommunication/online/digital/fmcg in Myanmar. I'd prefer working in senior operations/strategy roles.

I've attached my latest resume. Please do inform me if you find anything suitable.
Date added: 2016-09-27 || Action: Prescreen || Met him for Wirecard Sales Operation Manager.

He has years of sales, operations and management. He has worked for 3 telecom operators - 2 in India and 1 in Myanmar: Ooredoo. He has experience with FMCG during his internship at Unilever in Arabia.
He was headhunted by an agency to work for Ooredoo and he took the job because of the challenge and the opportunity to manage a team. He is managing 4 people now at Ooredoo and was working independently at the last position at his previous job.

He did not take an opportunity before to manage a large team because he feels he was not ready and need to learn and enhance his leadership skills.
Now he is ready and confident.

Ambitions:
Operations and Sales Director(Cold Sales PNL)
Analytics Head (Database Management)
Last option: Pre-sales Lead at Technology firm
Preferred Industry: FMCG, Telecoms, E-Commerce

I want to forward him to Wirecard, but
He wants to see first details of the scope of work and more information about the company before he can decide.

CS: $5,000 net per month
+housing allow=$1,500
+insurance (includes his wife)
+2-way airtickets home once a year with his wife
+Onboarding and back home expenses

ES: Negotiable, what's right for the role + benefits
higher position = increment from the current one

NP: 2 months (it is in the contract)

Date added: 2016-09-27 || Action: Outbound Call || He sent his CV before and followed up today. 
Called to set a meeting and see if he would be good for Wirecard or Viber."

Date added: 2016-09-28 || Action: Prescreen || Called his phone through Skype for Crown.

He is very good.
He is part of 2 companies that transformed from traditional, disorganized to a better system - Holcim and Samco Timber.
He had stayed with Holcim for 9 years and over 1 year with Samco. Although he does not close his doors for new opportunities, he thinks he needs to complete the phase of transformation with Samco before leaving it. Also it is not good for his career to move out right away.. it might take 4-5 years more.
He enjoys working in Indonesia and says the country is also in the under an exciting transformation and so there are so many opportunities opening up just like Myanmar.

I advised him to think about it before making a final decision.

Date added: 2016-09-29 || Action: Prescreen || Jolyn and I met him at Aquila.

Very good candidate for wirecard. 

first job was at KMD Group of Companies
from October 2002 to– August 2009 (6 years 11 months)
his responsibilities was lecturing, doing sales for computer items under sales department. 
At there, he got a lot of networks and knew many bosses. 

After KMD, he moved to Xpress Distribution Pte Ltd, singapore based company as Sales &amp; Marketing Manager because he knew with the boss of Xpress very well while he worked KMD.
from February 2010 to December 2011 (1 year 11 months).

Until now, he is helping to the boss of Xpress on the side of friendship. 

After xPress, he moved to KKA Computer Center as Director of Sales and Marketing. KKA boss is one of his friends, and he was helping him with running retail mobile shops in the rural areas. 

After xPress, he seemed like he is a bit jumping his past career background for me. But he says that ""you may think I am a bit jumping but there is a lot of good reasons on moving, I don't want to just sit and go home all the times, I want more challenging experience. But now is a good time for me to settle down for one company for 5 or 10 years with my age and I've already had a lot experiences."" 

He says he believes he can do for the role of Wirecard. And, he can promise to stay for a longer and make yearly contract to work with wirecard. He has a lot of positive energy about wirecard as current company, at Myanmar Millennium Group (MMG), he is dealing with many banks, head of bank management for this kind of business industry. 

CS: probationary period : 3500 USD net and now 3800 USD net per month

ES: negotiable

Notice Period: 1 month

Date added: 2016-09-29 || Action: Prescreen || Met him with Du Sar Mee for Wirecard Sales Operations Director.

He is a good fit. I am just a little concerned because in his past 3 jobs, including the current one, he has just stayed for few months. and these companies are operating in similar platform with wirecard.
He was saying it is difficult in the past 2 companies because of the management. He is happy with the current one, but is looking for a job where he can stay longer as he is in his 30s and needs a stable job. 
asked if he can not stay in his current company for a long time, he said he can but is open to other opportunities.
When introduced to Wirecard, he said yes right away and not expecting an increment. 

His experience and knowledge and his sales and presentation skills though are relevant to the role for wirecard so I am forwarding him. He also said he will make sure he will stay long on the next job because he himself knows it is the proper time for him. 

see scanned interview notes.
Date added: 2016-09-28 || Action: Outbound Call || he will meet with us on 29th of September at 3P.M in the Aquila office."

Date added: 2016-11-28 || Action: Outbound Call || Called Jessica to see if she would be interested in the Deputy Head of Sales and Performance Management role at Yoma Bank. She only wants to move to an international company and does not want to consider Yoma.
Date added: 2016-10-14 || Action: Prescreen || Met her for the Compliance position for UOB. 
Very nice lady. very smart.

Sure she can do the job for compliance at UOB, but UOB has been very picky so I don't think I will forward her only because she does not have experience in Banks and at PWC  she has been doing tax and BD for the past years and was just given the compliance section few months ago.  Also she is too expensive for UOB for the position.

She resigned 2 months ago because she has been with the company since the beginning and although she has the highest position in her area, she has has done everything already and nothing new. They created this new department and they put her in charge so she stayed. She's still open for better ops though.

She wants to work for a international companies that have good reputation. The name of the company is important, it does not matter if it is a start up in Myanmar. She has started PWC here so it is something she could do again.
She does not want to work for a stingy company or a company that cannot pay high and asks for too much.

She is known ehre because of the BD works she has done. She has been headhunted many times by many of their clients.

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Presentable
Professional
Arrived 13 mins before
Singaporean – Not holding Myanmar passport anymore

Ambitions and next job move

Join a MNC firm where ideas are receptive and has autonomy


Reason for leaving
Mitsubishi (still working here): Japanese are so used to stressful environment and their culture of giving too much respect to the Senior; can’t say anything even if you are right once they are in more Senior role than you
Fumo Engineering: Norwegian young boss – they don’t pay his salary for months, get business plan from him and stop sending him money
Arena: Company drew out investment from the company
Ritz: Returned to Myanmar to be with his family as he has been so alone in Singapore for over 15 years, also as he got offer from Arena



Motivators

Autonomy
Idea Receptive Culture – pin pointed working with European or Sophisticated professionals 


Notes

Has managed five countries for each year while in Sg; Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Hong Kong.  

Have extensive experience in staring the company from the scratch, building the team and managing accounts. Interested in Management roles connected with Sales. 
MM Cars – doing from ordering the vehicles to delivering the cars …. 50 booking each month – 4-5 vehicle sales with the car market and regulation system in Myanmar. Build the sales structure and process from ground zero – as former manger (used to work 7 years in Toyota and only 1 year in MM) deleted all the information as it was a bitter split with the company. Former GM was very good, but moved to Volswagen (one of six units YOMA has for JV). Reporting to 2 GM – YOMA (daily) &amp; Mitsubishi. 

Have received 3 offers from; Cement, Logistics and Media (if I heard it correctly). But didn’t take any of them as they want him to set up the company … he had had 2 bad experience already. Unless they have huge capital amount saved in the bank, he won’t take the uncalculated risk anymore. 
CS: $ 3000 USD + Visa Run Expense (Flight + Visa Fees) + Petrol Expense + Phone Bill Allowance + Incentive (not given at the moment, company is making losses each month; Showroom open only in 2015 December)
ES: Negotiable

Date added: 2016-10-06 || Action: Prescreen || She was contacted by DSM.
Met her with Felix at Coffee Circle.

She is not interested moving to a new company in the near future. If she ever considers it wouldn't be at any financial institutions because she does not want to work with a competitor.
She will not consider tobacco and alcohol to give respect to her parents. She added though at it really all depends on th job nature also. HR should be safe as she will be taking care of the well being of employees not really asking people to buy the products.

She is interested in our services for their sr recruitment mostly from Singapore. AYA prefers people from Singapore are they think it is easier for them to adapt to the culture.

Date added: 2016-11-03 || Action: Left Message || 	 	
Dear Jolyn,
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet the Chairman of Ngwe Yi Pale (Crown cement)
As I did with Kevin the first time and with Dr Shein the second time, I introduced myself and then presented the way I could bring value to the company when developing the company from a Sales &amp; Marketing point of view. Please find below my comments
Assumptions
. Crown has been running for years as a small size company in a regional environment
. Crown is willing to invest 200 Mio USD and x by 4 their production capacity in a cement facility
. Crown Directors didn't share with me any supporting document nor they gave their view about the business development. The meeting has always been one way oriented: I present myself and give my input on how I would develop the business activity. 
. The actors around Crown are investors. None of them have closely managed the company at the operational level. Thus they don't have a comprehensive understanding of what is at stake to multiply by 4 the turnover and to become a national player in the construction materials industry. 
. There are some issues totally under estimated, mainly 1. Technical 2. Human (Resources)
. Prior to any investment, (1) a feasibility study and (2) a business plan must be established. This is not the case of Ngwe Yi Pale. 
  A CMO or a MD role is to establish a P&amp;L and a forecast with a strategic plan and to implement it, to make it happen. 
  However, if there is no original investment and business plan, agreed by all, backed up by some fundamentals showing the ability to grow with some milestones, we are in a  
  situation of putting the cart before the horse which will lead to frustration and disillusion.
Conclusion
I am very reserved about the project proposed in the actual circumstance. There is an apparent gap between the intention of the investors and the reality of the project, for endogenous 
and exogenous reasons. 
I remain open to further discussion in case Kevin considers the situation I describe above is invalid or subject to some upcoming
Best regards
Christian

Tried to join AIT in Thailand for Studies, got only half-scholar so didn’t go – instead worked at Apacon (his report – Yon Chi Gon, Malaysian Manager –speaks Thai fluently) and he kind of glad that as the degree from the uni doesn’t count internationally. Got Master from NUS in 2002 – rank 12/13 best uni worldwide. 
Got offer from Traders Hotel and Suprasum (Itlalian Thai firm – No1’s sister company) as soon as he graduates but he took Suprasum; more income – 20,000 baht. Was amongst the 12 staff sent by Ministry of Manpower for the graduate from 85 – 96. He was the youngest. All taken to Thai for 6 months training to build Hotel Grand Mee Ya Htar in Yangon. 10 were sent back home to do construction; only him and 1 were asked to stay in Thailand due to their caliber and quality. 

Most memorable work place: Marina (owner side)
Happy and want to work as long as he can: Pillar (contract) – company got bankrupt
Got offer from Myanmar many times even from 65 Residence, Mastesh (spell as I heard, not sure if the spelling is correct), but reluctant to come back as he has family in Singapore and not over the moon to work for his friends firms."

Phone Interview 

Presentation &amp; Communication Skills

Great
Very good Burmese
Applied PR already and still in the process, Staying in Sg with employment Pass, Wife and daughter - Primary 5 are on dependent pass
Straightforward and honest


Ambitions and next job move

Want to work in Developer company rather than contractor as he wants to get involve heavily in Consultant Management and Budget Management


Reason for leaving


Techkon: Taken back by Ang Cheng to take on Project Management of private sector
Ang Cheng: HHed by Techkon (Developer) -one of the five Project Managers from Ang Cheng joined Techkon first and recommended him to directly recruit him.

ICRC: let go of 90 employees, so he went to Sg


Motivators

Working with Developer
Heavy involvement in Consultant Management and Budget Management


Notes

Reliable and result-oriented. Favoured by the clients due to his performance and delivering quality promises within given given timeline and budget, which he mastered working at NGO in Myanmar. 
Took MBA to improve his skills. Had to leave company after 6 months as the MBA required him to do 6 months full time class and do part time studies afterwards. 
Come back to Myanmar min once a year. Came back in July this year to sign contract for buying a room in Star City.

Recently finished project - 14 million SGD Condo 
Project team: 6-7, General Worker/ Subcontractors 60-70
2 proudest projects - 
1. Was given a Shipyard project; building 5 warehouses when he first joined Ang Cheng. First time in Sg, had no one to ask for suggestions and how to look for sub-cons and work with ministries in SG. He made it anyway 
2. Building a 7 storeys office with only only 3 people - CM, SM and MME coordinator within very tight budget and timeline. 

Current company grade in construction is A2. Wants to upgrade to A1, but as the BOD is family oriented one, not improving as much as it should. 

Sticking with them as he wanted to grow together and overcome the challenges. Management will change within 2 years time. Under his direct management, 14 people from Tender departments - Myanmar, Philippinos, Sirlankan and Indian. Whole company 40 staff and 250 General Workers. 

Within last 8 months, though company submitted 20 tenders, won only one from the public sector to build Stadium in schools. He is in charge of and the only capable person making Technical Proposals for all the tenders; costing - done inclusively. Used to have 4 teams in the whole company, but now only two left due to recesssion. 

CS: 8500 SGD Gross + General Insurance + Bonus 1 Month is fixed - depends on performance of the company can go up to 2.5 months
ES: 20% increment (if he has to return Myanmar, he needs to leave his wife and daughter in Sg. Prefer if the company can employ him under Sg entity so that dependent pass won't be a problem. If not, he'll need higher salary.)
NP: 2 months (might be able to negotiate down to 1 month)

Date added: 2016-12-13 || Action: Email || Dear Chloe and Nathaniel,

I have very recently moved to Yangon and was given a heads up about
Aquila, through friends. As I am looking for opportunities in
Management Consulting and General Management, it naturally caught my
attention.

I have been working for J.P.Morgan for the past almost-4 years, in the
Strategy Consulting department. Projects included Product Launch, Risk
Analysis, Business Strategy, and Corporate Relations. At the side, in
the recent months, I have been leading a voluntary consulting project
for the Ashoka and J.P. Morgan partnership dedicated to mentoring
Social Entrepreneurs in Developing Countries.

While working for a large bank and liaising with senior stakeholders,
I was part of a dynamic department which adopted a very hands-on
approach, contributing to my ability to adapt to different
professional environments.

Prior to my time in J.P. Morgan, my professional experiences include
Business Development and Senior Management in Start-ups (Lazada
Vietnam and Groupon UK, launched and financed by Rocket Internet GmbH)
and Asset Management (Strategic Markets at BNP Paribas).
In general I view myself as having a strong and versatile management
and consulting profile and I am keen to take on new challenges.

I would be thrilled to discuss my skillset and potential 2017
opportunities with you.
I am attaching my most updated CV for your perusal.

Best,

Ludovica Fabbro"

Date added: 2016-12-13 || Action: Email || Dear Sirs.
I am taking the liberty of sending my CV to your Human Resource department..
I have been working in the manufacturing field of luxury consumer goods in Asia for the past 38 years.  The last 16 years have been exclusively in the making of jewelry.
Before the new millennium, I was mainly in garment production and in January 2000 my journey into the jewelry world started in Vietnam as Director of ""Design International"" where I successfully brought the factory to higher levels in both quality and quantity.  What began as a small operation with 350 workers grew into a much more successful business with 3,000 workers in 2006 with a monthly output of up to 200,000 gold pieces and the yearly turnover which jumped from 12 to 67 million.
In 2010, I was approached by John Hardy who gave me an opportunity to make a break from ""Design International"" and start all over again in Bali ""the Island of the Gods"". As General Manager I had the full responsibility of running all the different aspects of their Balinese site.
 
After John Hardy I was offered the position of Managing Director by ""Reminiscence – Paris” a world leader in costume jewelry.
 
Currently, I am based in China as jewelry Production Director of a well know European Brand
Should you require any further information which may shed some light on my working experience in Asia, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely.
 
Guy Peemans"
