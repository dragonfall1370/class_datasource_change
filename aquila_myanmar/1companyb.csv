This is a process which will require substantial investment in the country's infrastructure (telecoms, power and transportation) and to upgrade the logistics and capacity associated with the manufacturing sector and agro-industry. Rekindled consumer demand will require a rapid development of Myanmar's financial services industry and a resurgent tourism industry will require a significant increase in facilities to cope with demand.

Company Overview: ABOUT US
Highland Metals Celebrates over 25 years!
“Wire is our passion, and our promise has always been to supply  every orthodontist with Simply Great Wire at affordable prices.”
–Ken Highland
In 1988, Ken Highland started Highland Metals Inc. with a personal mission to offer orthodontists high quality arch wire at affordable prices. Unafraid to take on the challenge of finding a solution to the problems he saw within the orthodontic arch wire industry, Mr. Highland developed and refined a manufacturing process for high quality Nickel Titanium archwires with excellent results: precision drawn NiTi wire that isn’t brittle – and one that doctors could easily bend using their own instruments.
His innovative, no-frills approach to wire-making changed the face (and the teeth) of the orthodontic wire-making industry. NiTi is what we’re famous for. Highland Metals emerged from Ken Highland’s garage and moved to a high quality manufacturing facility, located in San Jose, California, and has since established itself as an industry leader and a trusted source for quality orthodontic wire. Today, tens of thousands of orthodontists all over the world choose Highland Metals wire because it is smooth, strong, easy to work with, and comfortable for their patients.
When the company first started, we only offered one kind of wire. Today, we offer a range of wire alloys; each being engineered to meet demanding standards for specific orthodontic use and treatment.
Since the start of our business, HMI has been committed to continued product improvement and innovation. Highland Metals was the first in the industry to offer NiTi on a Spool, Tri-Ang wire, High Torque NiTi, NiTi V-Notch Archwire and more. After years of testing and refinement, Mr. Highland and his team successfully created our BetaBlue Archwire: a stronger, more reliable, nickel-free titanium alloy than other Beta Titanium products.
Wire is not a sideline for us. Wire is the core of our company; our focus, our passion. Though a lot has changed over the past 25 years, making sure we provide you with superior quality, value, and outstanding customer service are still our top priorities never will. Simply Great Wire is not just a slogan, it’s our promise to every doctor who uses our wire.
We are thankful for all the support Highland Metals has relished over the years, internally and externally, from our amazing staff, to our loyal customers.
High Quality
Our commitment to providing top quality products at reasonable prices mean we spend money on quality control, not fancy packaging. At Highland Metals, every step of the manufacturing process is closely monitored and tested to meet our exact specifications; we don’t accept anything but the absolute best. All HMI wire must pass over 50 quality checks that include force deflection, flatness, workability, shape conformance, elasticity, size, strength, polish, and smoothness. Also, unlike other manufacturers’ products, our wire is never brittle.  You can always rely on Highland Metals for the superior quality that saves you time and money.
Excellent Customer Service
It is our business to make your life easier. Fast, efficient service is just as important as our high quality products. Your time is valuable and our goal is to ship your order within 2 business days. Also, for your most immediate needs and concerns, our friendly, knowledgeable Customer Service Representatives are on hand to answer your call – our reps do not have voice mail so you’ll never get a machine during normal business hours.
Mission Statement
Highland Metals’ mission is to provide patient satisfaction by serving clients, staff, and suppliers with integrity, excellence, teamwork, and wisdom.
