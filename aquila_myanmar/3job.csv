			<p>The role involves managing all aspects of Revenue Management, Revenue Integrity and Pricing within the defined area of responsibility including liaising with other directly related staff within Commercial and externally with other key external partners such as Sales, Marketing, Operations and Customer Services at the airports.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The Head of RM will ensure that Airline&rsquo;s network is optimised and set up in line with the financial budget plan for the financial year.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Ensures the RM, RI and Pricing teams delivers effective:</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Prices.</li>
				<li>Flights are optimally controlled.</li>
				<li>Bookings are controlled within the Airline&rsquo;s booking and ticketing rules.</li>
				<li>Revenue targets are achieved or exceeded.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>The appropriate revenue is delivered according to the prescribed booking conditions set</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>The No-shows targets are reached but not exceeded.</li>
				<li>Periods of poor demand are identified by the team and communicated to appropriate areas for action to stimulate demand with Pricing initiatives where appropriate.</li>
				<li>Distribution fees are minimalized.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The job has 5 main impacts &ndash; ensuring revenue targets are reached whilst minimising costs.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Failure to optimise the revenue through mix management results in turning away high yielding business because earlier booking low yielding business has been accepted.&nbsp; This in turn also encourages the growth and expectation of the availability of lower fares in the market if not managed properly.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Overbooking to compensate for no-shows and cancellations is one of the means used to ensure seat factors are maximised. The failure to carry out this task to the required standard results in wasted seats or an increase in offloads and downgrades with consequential impact on customer perception and staff morale at airports.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Pricing devise the correct fares, rules and initiatives to generate business and be competitive in the marketplace.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The RI area ensures bookings are firmed as soon as possible to minimise costs no-shows and wastage.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Identify, develop and implement measures to optimise revenue generation opportunities.</li>

The failure to carry out this task to the required standard results in wasted seats or an increase in offloads and downgrades with consequential impact on customer perception and staff morale at airports.</li>

	<li>Given we are a retail chain, the candidate should have retail chain management expertise for at least two years. Also it is important to ask how much revenue the manager has managed before? We would hope candidates have managed annual sales of over $10m.</li>
	<li>Familiar with all aspects of the business: Sales team management, Merchandizing, inventory and logistics... In particular, if the candidate has had experience leading a large sales force, that is a big plus</li>
	<li>Candidate should not be a jumper... we&#39;ve seen a lot of candidates who have joined jobs for less than a year and have just jumped around for higher pay... those are probably the worst candidates for us to consider. As we don&#39;t believe you would have gained much knowledge having worked at a place for less than a year</li>
	<li>Myanmar talent pool is quite limited, given how the market has evolved just in the past three years, so a lot of locally trained senior managers would not have the relevant skill set to grow a business in this new environment.
