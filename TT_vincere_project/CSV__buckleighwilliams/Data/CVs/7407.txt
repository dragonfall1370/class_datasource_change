Contract:			Amp 2 C.S.O. Improvements 
Period:				September 1998 to January 2002
Position:			Project Quantity Surveyor 
Company:			Costain Civil Engineering
Responsible to:			Area Surveyor
Main Contract:			E.C.C. Option C
Method of Measurement:	n/a
Actual Target Cost Value:	£10,000,000.
Client:				Dwr Cymru


At intervals along the old trunk sewers within the Lynfi and Ogmore Valleys and also within Haverfordwest town centre, a number of existing combined sewer overflows provided temporary storage and overflow facilities for the sewage during storm conditions.  The project upgraded elements of the existing sewer so that the frequency and volume of discharges were reduced to acceptable levels thus improving the water quality of the rivers.

I was responsible for the development of the Initial Target Cost, from the feasibility stage and the costing of various options, to the agreement of the Actual Target Cost.  During the construction period I liaised with the client’s quantity surveyor, produced financial reports and managed a team of three quantity surveyors whose duties included the payment of subcontractors.

During the construction there were two major insurance claims, one of which involved the pollution of the River Lynfi and the prosecution of the Company by the Environment Agency.  I produced all documentation for the submission of the claims and liaised with the company solicitor for the presentation of a defense statement in court.

The Haverfordwest contract presented its own problems where, due to certain contract conditions, a tunneling machine was required to construct the new sewer.  This machine had difficulties and eventually had to be removed by open trench methods.  This led to adjudication with the subcontractor, followed by the early stages of arbitration, prior to the account being settled.  I responded to all documentation during the adjudication and presented the written documents for the arbitration.

Contract Tender Value:		£474,000
Client:				Cardiff Bay Development Corporation

The contract involved improving the flood defence, from both the tidal River Rhymney and the sea itself, by increasing the height and width of the existing 1.5m embankments.  At two points on the site the meander of the River Rhymney was too close to construct an enlarged embankment and here a sheet piled retaining structure was constructed, with a total length of 200m.  A permanent council gypsy camp and a Welsh Water sewage pumping station were located at the eastern end of the site and at these locations the toe of the seaward side of the existing 8m embankment was at high tide level.  Additional protection was given to this embankment by placing a concrete block revetment for a distance of 400m.

I was responsible for the finance of the structural element of the contract, which included a 320m-piled viaduct on the bank of the river Usk.

I assisted the project surveyor in the submission of a claim document to recover additional costs associated with these delays and variations.
