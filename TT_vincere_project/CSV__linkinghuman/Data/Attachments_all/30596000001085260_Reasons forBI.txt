I have used Crystal reports for automating letter batches and for invoices at Prism medical.
I have optimised a ERP invoice using crystal reports.
I created the sales dashboard which showed departmental progress in the month highlighting the number of application per cal staff and if they had met their targets against the month.
THe managers thier praised this report as it automated what was a manual daily report.
I also created a call stats graph SSRs report showing individual and departmental data which was appreciated by the business manager. This report I had to liase with this manager to work out his KPIs and how he wanted the information to help him assess the business.

I learnt SSIS and SSRs at motormile and worked in a team to get 100 gb of customer white data into a database. 

I want to learn the full micorosft BI stack so that I can be complete BI developer and handle all MI queries. It allows you to do a complete and proper analysis.



Experience with SQL Server (where you’ve worked with it? When you’ve worked with it?
talkttalk + 7 years , motormile, prism and carfinance247 = 2 years

Experience with SSIS and SSRS (where/when you’ve worked with it?) motormile and carfinance247 

Willingness to learn and how you’ve demonstrated this (in a technical sense)
I underwent the online training for qlikview and also spent a weekend to learning excel VBA so that I could complete a police invetigation for call records for a particular company.

Evidence of how you’ve got your ‘hands dirty’.
I incorporated windows batch files with SSIS routines to automate a a daily csv file load.

How quickly you’ve picked up new technical skills and overcome problems?
SSIS was difficult to get the data size for certain columns and to clean data. Used tools such as text editors and excel to clean data.
LEarnt SSRS expressions to carry out logic for dispaly fields.
