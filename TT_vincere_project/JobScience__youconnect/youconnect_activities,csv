Cover letter: Dear Madam, Sir,   I’m glad to apply for the open position “Corporate Legal Officer - Sabena Aerospace - Brussels”.  I have been working since 2012 as a lawyer at the Brussels Bar, handling lawsuits in Belgian torts law, contract and insurance law (including criminal law aspects) on behalf of our law firm, Racine Brussels, which focuses on providing legal advice and litigation assistance to business clients.  Although being a lawyer is a very exciting job, I’m currently looking for a new challenge and, while checking my LinkedIn-profile a few days ago, I discovered the above-mentioned open position at Sabena Aerospace Brussels. I have to be honest: I never heard about this company before. Yet I was immediately interested in learning to know it, since I’m quite “passionate” about both civil and military aviation. The job we’re talking about would hence be an opportunity to combine this passion with the legal knowledge and skills I acquired so far during my career as a lawyer, among them: drafting or negotiating contracts, looking for solutions when (potential) problems arise (specific legal problems, for instance with contracts, or numerous kind of problems with “legal aspects”), providing general legal advice (with a specialization in the field of Belgian contract, torts and insurance law). I would be glad to offer those skills in order to serve and reach the specific goals of the Sabena Aerospace company -and it’s clients-  as well as to improve them and to learn new skills and abilities, or improve (if applicable, specific) language knowledge. I’m currently living and working in Brussels, and I will of course be glad to provide you with any further information you might need.  In any case, thank you for your consideration.   Sincerely.  Jean-Paul VAN DE WALLE

Cover letter: Dear Ms. Verhaegen,  I wish to apply for the position of a legal counsel with Komatsu in Vilvoorde.   Over the past 10 years, I gained in-depth professional experience as a lawyer in EU (competition) law and Belgian commercial law at the international law firms Allen & Overy LLP, Covington & Burling LLP and the BeNeLux law firm Strelia. While focusing on defending companies in disputes and investigations, I also acquired broad experience in advisory work and drafting commercial contracts.  I have a keen interest in this position at Komatsu, given its broad scope of legal fields and the opportunity to contribute to the activities of an international manufacturing company in Europe and Africa. Having spent my childhood in Nigeria, I am a native English speaker. I also have a mother-tongue level in Dutch and a good working level in French.  I look forward to your feedback on my application for this role at Komatsu.  Yours sincerely,  Siegfried Omanukwue

Cover letter: Dear Mrs Beeuwsaert,   I am interested in the position of Lead Lawyer Purchasing at Solvay  As a senior lawyer with high-level negotiation experience in connection with complex industrial projects, I learned how to find a balance between the legal requirements and the business objectives.  During the first part of my career, I developed high quality legal analysis skills while working for very demanding law firms. After having left the Brussels Bar, I decided to remain self-employed and to combine different functions at the same time.   As from 2011, my main activity consisted in working as a sole lawyer in the oils & fat industries. This new position was extremely challenging as I was providing support in a broad range of legal matters. My main tasks were leading the litigation and drafting, reviewing and validating sales and purchase agreements. I quickly became a business partner which gave me the legitimacy to suggest creating a proper legal department.   With the support of my department, I had more time to develop a transversal responsibility for managing legal affairs globally, including our affiliates located in China, Malaysia, India, Singapore, Argentina, Brazil, USA, Russia, Italy, France and UK. During my visits to our main affiliates, I established a network of external lawyers in the most relevant countries for our business.  Relying on a department also allowed me to dedicate more time to run training programs and information sessions to my colleagues, including those of the purchasing department.  We improved the existing templates of agreements and general terms and conditions and launched a process of negotiating and signing frame agreements with our main suppliers.  When I read Solvay’s job offer I immediately though that would be an opportunity to continue growing and developing my skills while bringing my experience, my knowledge and my excellent interpersonal skills to the service of a very exciting company.  If you have any question or want to know more about my qualifications, please do not hesitate to contact me. My cell phone number is 0476 76 12 88 and my email is pierrebruwier@hotmail.com  I look forward to hearing from you about this position.  Sincerely,  Pierre Bruwier

Cover letter: Beste  Ik ben een tweedejaarsstudente Rechtspraktijk aan de Arteveldehogeschool. Vorig jaar studeerde ik af als Officemanager, met als afstudeerrichting Event & Projectmanagement. Momenteel ben ik dus bezig aan mijn 2e bachelor. Als afstudeerstage liep ik vorig jaar stage bij Dinner On The Lake. Na de stage heb ik nog enkele maanden echt voor hen gewerkt (customer service) en dit was van thuis uit. Ik heb door die ervaring gemerkt dat ik over de nodige discipline beschik om van thuis uit te kunnen werken.   Vorige week had ik reeds contact met Stéphanie waarbij ik haar ook al deze informatie meegaf en zij stelde toen voor dat ik een mail stuurde naar Mieke met daarin mijn CV.   Aangezien ik echter zeer enthousiast ben over deze vacature, geef ik via deze manier nogmaals mijn kandidaat door. Ik zou namelijk erg graag ervaring opdoen in de juridische professionele wereld en deze studentenjob lijkt me de ideale start.   Ik kijk alvast uit naar jullie antwoord!  Met vriendelijke groeten Naomi Bordon
