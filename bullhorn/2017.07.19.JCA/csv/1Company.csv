Bureau Veritas? history dates back to 1828 when it was established in Belgium solely as a marine services provider to assess the trustworthiness of ships and to ensure the safety of their crew and cargo. Having created and set the ship-building standards world-wide, the Marine Sector Division remains the flagship of Bureau Veritas. Bureau Veritas has since expanded its operations, mainly through acquisitions, to include services catering to a wider range of business sectors including Aeronautics and Space, Government Services, International Trade, Industry and Trade Facilities, and Consumer products divisions to which international standards are applied.

Company Description: Quickflange is a company delivering technology for ""cold"" operations involving pipe and flange connections. 
The QF technology consists of a hydraulic tool enabling a flange-to-pipe connection without the use of heat or any other potential ignition sources.

Our equipment is rented out on a day-rate basis, and the actual operation of the equipment is carried out by QF-certified personnel from the oil companies´ MMO suppliers. The idea was conceived in 2003, and Quickflange has developed the technology from the idea to a commercial product through co-operation with Statoil ASA (LUP program) and Innovation Norway.
The first QF-connection offshore in Norway was delivered to the Gullfaks platform in 2005, installed by personnel from Aker Kvaerner Offshore Partner.
Quickflange AS is established with headquarters in Forus outside of Stavanger. The branch office in Tvedestrand is our technology center, handling production and assembly of hydraulic tools, logistics and QHSE, as well as development of new technology .

Company Description: When MOBOTIX developed the first weatherproof web cam with digital image sensors and an integrated PC back in 1999, no one could ever have imagined the impact this would have on the future of video surveillance. The transmission of video streams over computer networks finally enabled video technology to depart from the restrictions of a TV standard which had applied for 60 years, bringing it in line with the megapixel image quality of modern-day digital cameras. MOBOTIX is the only network camera manufacturer to date that is capable of storing smooth high-resolution video streams with 1536 lines instead of the usual 288, including sound. The new technology isn't just more powerful in all areas, it also has two decisive advantages: it is more cost-effective than traditional CCTV video technology and more multi-functional thanks to its integrated computer and network connection.Standard Perm Fee (%): 0

Company Description: 
Beauty is not created by adding one more detail, it is conceived by removing the last.
The design of our collection represents a way of thinking that reduces each product to the essential components without compromise. Luminance and illumination are the primary goals. The luminaire, a detail that can reflect and integrate within architecture with the purest form that will enhance and add value to its environment, requires a deep understanding of the intrinsic nature and unified components of architectural styles. These components can be condensed into basic forms, which Kreon exploits within its products. This approach to design requires that the details of an object are not merely decorative, but are key to the essence of the product as a whole. Kreon products, in their simplest forms, do not result in austere minimalism, but in architectural objects that communicate with space, regardless of style. This, combined with careful planning, represents the true meaning of ""architectural lighting"".Kreon, purity in light gives you the opportunity to create the conditions that allow the beauty of architecture to surface.Standard Perm Fee (%): 0

Travelport is headquartered in Langley, UK. The company recently completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol ""TVPT&rdquo;.

History[edit]

Travelport traces its origins back to 1971, but its most immediate predecessor, Travel Distribution Services (TDS), was founded in 2001 through the acquisition of Galileo International by TDS's parent,Cendant Corporation. Travelport was formed in August 2006, whenCendantsold Orbitz and Galileo toThe Blackstone Groupin a deal valued at $4.3 billion.

In April 2006, shortly before Travelport was sold, Cendant hiredJeff Clarkeas president and CEO of Travel Distribution Services to lead the sale of the division. He is currently a member of the board of directors of Travelport and chairman of the board of Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. Gordon Wilson was appointed President andCEOof the company and a member of the board of directors of Travelport in June 2011.

Shortly after the Blackstone-led buyout, in December 2006, Travelport struck a deal to buy one of its rivals, Worldspan, for $1.4 billion.[1]

In May 2007 the company filed a registration statement with theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionto sell a portion ofOrbitz Worldwidein aninitial public offering(IPO). The IPO was priced on July 20, 2007, opening at $15.00 per share, and closed on July 25, 2007. A month later, Travelport completed the Worldspan deal, integrating Worldspan with Galileo.

By combining operations with Worldspan and streamlining overlapping functions that Travelport had inherited from a string of more than 20 earlier mergers under Cendant, Travelport cut its overhead by $390 million in three years and doubled its cash flow.[2]

On September 19, 2007, Travelport became the first travel company to receive a 100 percent rating on the sixth annualCorporate Equality Indexawarded by theAmerican Human Rights Campaign Foundation.[3]Worldspan achieved the 100 percent rating on HRC's Corporate Equality Index in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.

On May 5, 2011, Travelport completed the $720m sale of its GTA (Gullivers Travel Associates) business toKuoni, in line with its strategic plan to focus on maximizing the potential of its core business.

Our team consists of highly skilled database specialists, programmers and graphic designers. We have developed a strong reputation for delivering valuable, cost effective systems through close customer relationships and our agile development processes.

Custom software delivery is our passion. Traditional projects get bogged down with a rigid set of requirements which are defined early on. Business users and the development team become distanced which often leads to failed outcomes. Our experts approach the problem differently by delivering features in short iterations. With the business using the software sooner, missed requirements and problem areas can be addressed earlier. Requirements can be changed without months of work being discarded.

With our test driven development approach we deliver higher quality, more reliable software quicker. Continuous integration means that our team of experts collaborate in the most efficient way and ensure that all new features are integrated efficiently into the project pipeline. Self testing software highlights bugs and problem areas sooner and brings complete transparency to the development process. It""s all about using the right technology to get things done right the first time.

With the best staff for the job we creatively drive forward our vision to deliver high quality business solutions to our customers. Our network of satisfied customers means the majority of our business comes through referrals.

Company Description: Science fiction and futurists over the last 50 years created images of what the future can look like. Many of these predicted technologies already exist today like for example cell phone technology and space travelling. One of the common themes predicted as early as the 1970""s by futurists has been objects reacting to people or other objects because they can sense the identity of the person or object. This recognition happens automatically and in none of these we see keys, card identification or biometrics. Identity is sensed and rule based actions are automatically triggered. Even though this has been envisaged for a long time it has still not been achieved.

The technology to wirelessly achieve this has been in existence for the last 20 years but it is still not implemented due to limitations in the radio frequency technology available today.

Hive Technology is the only independent provider of a single identification technology. We help organizations exploit the full potential of &lsquo;Internet of Things"". Hive encourages enterprises to outline a roadmap that provides them the ultimate clarity and direction for overcoming the hurdles in driving their IoT initiatives.

Hive Technology is based in the UAE with subsidiaries in South Africa and Ireland, which develop and own the advanced Broadcast Beacon and security technology.

Hive offers a progressive beacon technology that allows solution architects to easily build product to a myriad of challenges in virtually every industry you can think of in no time.

Hive Technology is the only ONE IDENTIFICATION and monitoring technology that connect people, animals and things (""objects&rdquo;) to the Internet of Things.

Company Description: NFPC (National Food Products Company) was founded in 1971 with the establishment of a dairy production facility in the middle of the Arabian Desert in Abu Dhabi.
With Milco starting its operations in the United Arab Emirates capital, we were committed from the start to two basic principles &ndash; quality and service.

In 1977, NFPC Started its own manufacturing plant for plastic cups Modern Plastic Company- MPC, a second addition to the group, and another first for the UAE.

In 1976, a group was established to import dairy products from Europe. The operation grew quickly and a joint venture company in partnership with the Danish / Swedish co-operative Arla, was established. Arla""s best-selling brands in the region are Lurpak, Three Cows and Puck.
In 1981 Long-life milk and fruit juices were added to NFPC products portfolio, when we bought LACNOR, a French-owned enterprise based in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.

In 1984 we established the UAE""s first bottled water plant&ndash; and started a trend which has made the country one of the world""s highest per capita consumers of bottles water, when Oasis has started its operation in the U.A.E.
Oasis Pure Water introduced its PET bottle range after the 5 Gallon best selling line, in 1997 to cater to the consumers"" on the go needs. A wide range of recyclable PET bottles in different sizes was offered &ndash; 100ml (cups), 300ml, 500ml, 1.5L and a 1 gallon &ndash; to accommodate various lifestyles. It expanded its portfolio in 2005 with adding Blu Sparkling Water to its products.

National Food Products Company is one of the premier food and beverage companies in the Middle East, a position we have won by responding and fulfilling our customers needs and expectations; and by looking after our employees and maintaining a high level of flexibility in our operations.

We believe that no company in the UAE is better prepared to seize the opportunities & meet the challenges of the 21st century than ourselves

What is Enterprise Performance Management (EPM)

Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) can be defined as tools used by executive decision makers to truly focus on profitability and performance for their business. This requires a performance management platform that provides historical information, current results, and predictive analytics.

Today’s performance managers need to know what’s happened and why; and align this knowledge with objectives to establish a forward-looking view of the business. As a result, there is a growing demand for such EPM tools as scorecards, dashboards, budgeting tools, accelerated financial close tools, Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s), business metrics, and other strategic management tools.

Company Description: Our mission has always been to help our customers achieve what matters most to them.

In 1993, we shipped our first data storage system to Patrick Mulrooney, who at that time was a system administrator at Tandem Computers. The network appliance was designed to clean up his infrastructure sprawl. He loved its simplicity.

""Patrick""s favorite attribute was that our system rebooted in 30 seconds instead of hours like our competitors,&rdquo; says NetApp co-founder, Dave Hitz. ""While solving his downtime problem, we also gave Patrick a competitive edge.&rdquo;

More than 20 years later, our story is still about delivering innovation that gives our customers an edge over their competitors. From the edge of the universe with CERN""s Large Hadron Collider, to the edge of human endurance in Formula One auto racing, we help you do things you couldn""t before&mdash;at speeds you never thought possible.

Throughout the world, leading organizations count on NetApp for software, systems, and services to manage and store their data. We help enterprises and service providers envision, deploy, and evolve their IT environments. Customers also benefit from our open collaboration with other technology leaders to create the specific solutions they need.

Our team is passionate about customer success. Our company culture and work environment support that dedication. Together with our global network of partners, we are united in one goal: to help our customers achieve the outcomes that matter most to them

Company Description: 



An innovative family business



From a Swabian workshop business to an internationally active SME (small to medium-sized enterprise) - this is how one can describe the development of the fischer company group since its foundation in the year 1948. The family business has always remained aware of its roots: the head office is still located in Waldachtal-Tumlingen in the northern Black Forest, about 60 km southwest of Stuttgart.

The characteristic feature of the company is its power of innovations, which has repeatedly led not only to the development of new products, but also the opening up of new areas of business. Today these are divisions of ""fischer Fixing Systems&rdquo;, ""fischer Automotive Systems&rdquo;, ""fischertechnik&rdquo; and ""fischer Consulting&rdquo;.
The group includes 43 national companies. Production sites are located in Argentina, Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, and the USA. In 2014, our 4,160 employees worldwide generated a consolidated turnover of &euro; 661 million.

The latest division, ""fischer Consulting&rdquo;, emerged from the skills developed in our own company. The fischer process system (fPS) introduced by the owner and long-time CEO Klaus Fischer (65) strives for continuous improvement. The company should be flexible and lean, and always oriented in its focus to the benefit for the customer.
The largest division is the Fixing Systems with more than 14,000 articles. The strengths of the company continue to lie in the technological leadership in important fields of fixing technology. Here the company is continuing what the founder Artur Fischer (94) began with his legendary invention, the nylon anchor, over 50 years ago: the company is still characterised today by the disproportionately large number of patents held.

This division will continue to form the core area of the group in the future. Klaus Fischer sees good opportunities here to expand further both on the domestic market and internationally. The strength of this division lies in providing the right product in technical perfection for a wide range of customers from the handyman to the craftsmen and on to key-account partners.

Another main pillar of the company is the automotive area, which offers kinematic interior solutions for all the greats of the automotive industry, produced under ultra-modern conditions at the Horb location.

""fischertechnik&rdquo; rounds off the product portfolio with its range of toys. The kits are classics in the sector of construction toys. These quality toys made in Germany have a worldwide following, and have been able to consolidate their position even further.

By December 2001, his U.S. company, Telephone Systems International, Inc. began seeking equipment vendors willing to build a phone system in a country still emerging from more than two decades of war. Afghan Wireless would battle logistical problems, political instability, physical insecurity and hours of environmental challenges to launch its service. Despite hardships, on April 6, 2002, His Excellency Hamid Karzai inaugurated the GSM network with an international call to Germany. The system was launched in a mere seven weeks after the arrival of the first equipment. Afghan Wireless is now the largest provider of telecommunications services in Afghanistan, with GSM mobile networks in 34 provinces: Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, Mazar-E-Sharif, and Jalalabad are just a few.

Company Description: Technology is taking over and we""re becoming more and more dependent on it. It has become the core of every business in every industry and it""s dominating consumer products and households with phones, laptops, tablets and smart home technologies. We built an on-demand model that connects the right Geek with the customer based on time, location and skill set. This allows the customer to get the most efficient service possible. Having your phone repaired in 20 minutes at your home or office is a service we all need as busy individuals. What sets us apart as a company is our core values. Transparency: We will always, always be upfront. Our relationship with our customers and colleagues is more important than our relationship with our bankers. When we do things with honest excellence, a purer form of success will follow. Quality: Let""s face it, a lot of people out there do some of what we do. So yes, it may sound clich&eacute; but our advantage is that we do it 10x better. And we""ll continue to do it better, over and over again. We practice persistence in our quality checks. We keep our eyes open for innovation, strategize to up-sell and aim to advance our skills. Always have the mentality to disrupt normality. Efficiency: Quality that takes more time than it should is no longer quality. Time is money and we don""t like spending more than we should. In this jungle, we must adapt like chameleons do.
